A fund with a higher expense ratio may mean lower overall returns for investors. Therefore, investors should invest in schemes with comparatively lower expense ratios.Credit quality: It is a common misconception that ultra-short duration fund investments do not carry any risk. Investors should remember that although these funds come with low interest rate risk, there is always a credit risk involved. This can mean loss of capital invested, therefore, it is advisable for investors to opt for schemes that invest in high credit quality instruments. Investment tenure: It is advisable to invest in these funds for approximately 3 – 12 months. For an investment tenure under 3 months, liquid funds are advisable over ultra short duration funds. For investment tenures over 12 months, debt funds are considered better than ultra short duration funds.Historical performance: An investor must consider the historical performance of the scheme that they want to invest in. Looking at the fund manager’s performance track record can also give insights into the fund’s profitability across different market and interest rate situations. ConclusionSince bond yields tend to change across different macroeconomic situations, monetary policy changes, exchange rate fluctuations and other factors, investors should avoid basing returns expectations as per short term fund performance. Investors must evaluate the various risk factors and weigh them against personal risk-taking ability to make an informed investment decision.FAQsHow to invest in ultra short duration funds?To invest in some of the best ultra short duration funds, investors can download the Fisdom  app and explore the top-performing funds to invest.
