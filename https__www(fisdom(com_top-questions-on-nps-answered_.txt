The scheme comes with multiple features and benefits that make it an attractive investment option for investors of all classes. Some of such features and benefits are discussed below.a. ReturnsThe returns of the NPS scheme are higher as compared to other government-backed schemes like PPF, SCSS, etc. This is on account of the equity portion of the investment which has the potential to generate higher returns as compared to the fixed and nominal returns of the schemes mentioned above.

Investors can get a deduction under Section 80C up to Rs. 1,50,000. An additional tax benefit under this scheme is under section 80CCD 1(B) up to Rs. 50,000 towards Tier I contributions. This takes the overall deduction up to Rs. 2,00,000. The employer contributions in the case of Tier I contributions are further eligible for deduction up to 14% in the case of Central Government and 10% in the case of other employers under section 80CCD (2). This additional deduction is over and above the deduction available under section 80C.c. Risk The risk of investment in NPS is minimal as the scheme is a government-backed scheme. The equity exposure in the scheme is capped at a maximum of 75% or 50% depending on the employer of the investor as well as their age.
