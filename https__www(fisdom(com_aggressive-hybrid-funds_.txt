These funds are a type of hybrid funds where the dominant investment (approximately 65% to 80% of the fund) is in the equity and equity-related instruments. The balance of the fund is in the debt instruments or money market instruments. The key benefit of aggressive hybrid funds is generating increased returns at the same time reducing risks on account of diversification of the asset class over the long duration of the fund. Another added advantage of aggressive hybrid funds is the benefit of arbitrage in the market. This benefit allows the fund manager to generate higher returns on account of price differences between different markets. Hence, the ability of the fund managers to pick quality investments that can meet investor expectations is crucial in aggressive hybrid funds.In addition to the capital gains tax, the dividends received from aggressive hybrid funds are also taxed in the hands of the investors. These dividends are added to the taxable income of the investor and taxed at the applicable income tax slab rates depending on the gross total income. Top aggressive hybrid funds to invest in 2023The top funds under this category are mentioned below:HDFC Hybrid Equity FundHDFC Hybrid Equity Fund belongs to the aggressive hybrid fund category.

This is on account of increased equity exposure which has the potential to provide higher returns than any other investment class.Diversification to equity and debt market Aggressive hybrid funds invest in both the equity and debt market. This diversification benefits investors as they get the benefit of both the markets. Investors do not have to invest in separate funds in equity and debt class which helps in reducing the expense ratio providing higher net returns. Investors can increase their investment in quality equity instruments at the time of decreased market trends.Balanced riskAnother key advantage of aggressive hybrid funds is the balance risk. The risk of investment in equity and equity-related instruments is highest whereas debt instruments have limited exposure. Aggressive hybrid funds help the investors balance the risk of the equity market against the debt market providing the net benefit of reduced risks to the investors.Risks associated with Agressive hybrid FundsThe risk of investment and aggressive hybrid funds are detailed belowThe risk associated with the debt marketAggressive hybrid funds have a portion of debt and debt-related instruments in the fund. This exposes the investor to the risk associated with the debt market like the credit risk interest rate risk as well as reinvestment risk and liquidity risk. These risks, although limited, can potentially impact the investment and reduce the net returns of the investors.The risk associated with equity marketsThe risk related to equity markets is the extreme volatility of the instruments to market fluctuations. This volatility can potentially wipe out the capital investment of the investors. It is there for prudent to invest in quality aggressive funds that have a proven track record and investment strategy of fund managers that are in line with that of the investor expectationsLimited exposure to debt market Debt markets provide limited but relatively stable returns and the risks associated are also lower as compared to equity markets. However, under aggressive hybrid funds, the exposure to the debt market is limited to approximately 20% to 40% maximum of the total fund. This further limits the earning potential through the debt market and may impact the net returns of the investors.What are the things to be considered while investing in aggressive hybrid funds?The several factors to be considered while investing in aggressive hybrid funds are mentioned below.Risks-return expectationsThe risk and return expectations of the investor are among the key parameters while making an investment decision in aggressive hybrid funds. The return earning potential is higher due to the presence of equity instruments along with limited risks on account of debt funds.Expense ratioThe expense ratio of investment in equity funds and debt funds separately will increase the overall cost of investment for the investors. Aggressive hybrid funds have the equity and debt funds together and the overall expense ratio is limited in comparison to individual funds.

Hence, investors should opt for funds that have a relatively lower expense ratio and provide higher returns along the way. Investment horizonThe investment horizon of the investors of aggressive hybrid funds should be medium to long term i.e., approximately 5 to 7 years. An investment of this duration will help them enjoy the benefit of potentially good returns as compared to other investments in similar categories like bank deposits, etc.Investment goalsAggressive hybrid funds are quite a good option to build a corpus fund that can help in realizing medium to long term investment objectives.

It is ideal to review and analyse the performance of the fund over the past few years before making an investment decision to ensure that the portfolio is of quality investment instruments that can generate higher returns in the long run. How are aggressive hybrid funds taxed?Hybrid funds invest in equity funds between 65 to 80% of the total fund.
