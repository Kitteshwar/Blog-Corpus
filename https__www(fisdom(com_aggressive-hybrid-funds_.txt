These funds are a type of hybrid funds where the dominant investment (approximately 65% to 80% of the fund) is in the equity and equity-related instruments. The balance of the fund is in the debt instruments or money market instruments. The key benefit of aggressive hybrid funds is generating increased returns at the same time reducing risks on account of diversification of the asset class over the long duration of the fund. Another added advantage of aggressive hybrid funds is the benefit of arbitrage in the market. This benefit allows the fund manager to generate higher returns on account of price differences between different markets. Hence, the ability of the fund managers to pick quality investments that can meet investor expectations is crucial in aggressive hybrid funds.In addition to the capital gains tax, the dividends received from aggressive hybrid funds are also taxed in the hands of the investors. These dividends are added to the taxable income of the investor and taxed at the applicable income tax slab rates depending on the gross total income. Top aggressive hybrid funds to invest in 2023The top funds under this category are mentioned below:HDFC Hybrid Equity FundHDFC Hybrid Equity Fund belongs to the aggressive hybrid fund category.

Investors do not have to invest in separate funds in equity and debt class which helps in reducing the expense ratio providing higher net returns. Investors can increase their investment in quality equity instruments at the time of decreased market trends.Balanced riskAnother key advantage of aggressive hybrid funds is the balance risk.

However, under aggressive hybrid funds, the exposure to the debt market is limited to approximately 20% to 40% maximum of the total fund.
