These are short-term investment instruments with a maturity of a maximum period of 1 year and are issued by the Government to raise capital or funds from the general public. These instruments are in the nature of zero coupon bonds i.e., instruments that do not provide interest like other debt instruments. However, these bills are issued at a discount and redeemed at par value or face value, the difference being the profit for the investors. As per RBI, treasury bills, or T-Bills, as they are more commonly known, are issued for a fixed tenure of varying maturity periods. The most common T-Bills available in India are of the maturity period of 91 days, 182 days, and 364 days. These maturity dates for the T-bills remain constant although the amount of face value of the bills and the discounted rates may vary from time to time depending on the funds that need to be raised through this instrument. Read more: What are the different types of Govt securities and how to invest in them?What are the features of treasury bills?After the basic meaning of treasury bills, let us now focus on the features of these instruments. Zero coupon bonds Treasury bills, unlike other debt instruments, do not carry a coupon rate or an interest rate that is provided to the investors during the tenure of investment. These bonds instead are issued at a discounted rate and redeemed at par value. For example, T-Bills for 91 days may have a face value of Rs. 100 but may be issued at a discounted value of Rs. 94. The maturity amount payable to the investors is at the rate of Rs. 100, therefore, the differential amount of rs.6 per T-Bill is the net gain for the investors depending on the total T-Bills subscribed. Standard investment option T-Bills are available at a standard investment option of a minimum of Rs.25,000. Any further investment in these instruments has to be in multiples of Rs. 25,000. Flexible maturity Investors have the option to invest for varying tenures offered under T-Bills. This increases the access to this investment for every category of investors who have different investment horizons.Available through auction and mutual funds Investors can access these bills and invest in them through various options like Weekly auctions by the RBI and placing bids for the same on the electronic platform E-Kuber or through NSE goBID appThrough Depository Participants like commercial banks, and registered primary dealers, By simply subscribing to the units of mutual funds that invest in treasury bills. What are the pros and cons of investing in treasury bills?Some of the key advantages of investing in treasury bills are highlighted below.ProsRisk-free investment option Treasury bills are government-backed securities and therefore the risk of investment in these instruments is nil.
