RudriRawellWritten by - Rudri RawellAugust 25, 2022  5 minutes  Floating rate term deposits (FRTDs) are a category of fixed deposits, in which the interest rate is not fixed for the deposit tenure. Unlike regular fixed deposits, in floating rate fixed deposits, the interest rate moves in sync with a certain reference rate, which is revised periodically. These deposits allow investors to benefit from interest rate changes without having to close or re-book the FD.   Table of Contents  hide   1 Understanding the concept of Floating Rate FDs   2 Key benefits of floating rate FDs   3 Which is better, floating rate FD or regular FD?   4 Floating rate FD offerings by banks   5 What do the experts say about Floating rate FDs?   6 Conclusion   7 FAQs Here is everything that an investor needs to know about floating rate FDs and how they work.Understanding the concept of Floating Rate FDsAs mentioned in the introduction, the interest rates on floating rate FDs are aligned to a benchmark instrument’s rate. Thus, the interest rate is variable. Since the benchmark reference rate is revised at regular intervals, the Floating FD interest rates also keep moving at regular intervals. Some of the benchmarks used for reference include the treasury bill rate, repo rate, etc. For example, if a three-year floating rate FD is being offered at an interest rate with a mark-up of 0.8% above the current repo rate of 4.5%, one can earn annual returns at 5.3%. In case the repo rate drops to 4% after a year, the floating rate FD interest rate will be revised to 4.8% per annum.Thus, Floating rate FDs can fetch good returns when interest rates are expected to rise. Investors can opt for floating rate FDs to benefit from a potential hike in interest rate in the near future. In case the interest rate trend is expected to go downward, floating rate FDs may become unrewarding over time. Key benefits of floating rate FDsSome of the benefits of investing in floating rate fixed deposits are:If the base rate is revised to a higher number, investors can benefit through higher returns. Some banks revise base rates every quarter.Floating FD interest is paid out on the last day of every quarter.

This facility can be availed within a day of request.The scheme also comes with a nomination facility.Senior citizens can enjoy a higher interest rate of up to 50 basis points above the regular interest rate on these FD schemes. Investors can also opt for premature withdrawal without paying any penalty subject to certain rules laid out by the specific bank.Which is better, floating rate FD or regular FD?The table below contains key differences that investors should know between Floating rate FDs and fixed deposits: Floating rate FDsFixed DepositsFalling Interest rate scenario Interest rates are generally lower than regular FD interest rates. Interest rates are generally higher than Floating rate FDs.Rising interest rate scenarioInvestors benefit through higher interest rates.Investors may not necessarily benefit if interest rates are fixed.Investment formatSomewhat complex to understand for investors Easy to understand by investorsDiversificationOffers portfolio diversification, especially if investing in different banks.Can be used for diversification but with limited returns.LiquidityPeriodic withdrawals up to a certain amount are permitted and do not attract a penalty.Withdrawals before tenure completion generally attract a penalty.Taxation TDS of 10% for those who provide PAN details.TDS of 10% for those who provide PAN details.
