Upon maturity, the most common option often exercised by accountholders is closing the account.

Investors can continue such accounts for an indefinite period without making any new contributions and get the benefit of earning interest on their PPF balance at the prevailing interest rates. When the investor exercises the option to continue the PPF account without any fresh deposits for a period of more than a year they cannot opt to continue the PPF account with fresh deposits. Accountholders, however, get the benefit of withdrawing from the account every year as per their requirement to the extent of the balance available in the account.Continue the account with fresh contributionsThe final option available to the PPF account holders is continuing the PPF account even after maturity and making fresh deposits in the same.
