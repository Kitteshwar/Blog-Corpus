By increasing the credit score, the cardholders can easily get an increased credit limit on their credit card. One of the easiest ways to increase credit score is to use the credit card in paying monthly bills and paying the credit card dues on time without any defaults.  Provide proof of increased incomeProof of an increased income can support the cardholder’s request to increase the credit card limit. It will assure the Bank of the timely repayment of credit card dues and the repayment capacity of the cardholder. The cardholder can show proof of a hike in salary or any alternate income source to support the request for an increased credit card limit.Application for new credit cardAnother easier way to increase the credit card limit is by applying for a new credit card. There are many types of credit cards available with ICICI Bank. if the cardholder has been repaying the credit card dues on a timely basis and has sound creditworthiness, the cardholder will get the sanction of a new credit card easily. Timely payment of credit card duesRepaying the credit card dues is very important to maintain the creditworthiness of the cardholder. This assures the bank of the sound repaying capacity of the cardholder. If the past dues of the cardholder are not cleared and have been carried forward, then they have to be cleared firstly at the earliest. Following this, the future credit card dues have to be cleared before the due date to assure the Bank that the cardholder is a good candidate for an increased credit limit.Reduction in existing liabilitiesExternal liabilities are always reviewed while considering a request for an increased credit card limit. When the cardholder makes such a request, it is preferable to reduce their external liabilities first like home loan installments, personal loan installments, other credit card dues, etc. Avoid 100% credit utilization ratioThe credit utilization ratio is the ratio of the total credit limit allotted to the cardholder and the actual credit availed by such cardholder. An ideal credit utilization ratio to be maintained by cardholders as per many experts is around 30%. A lower credit utilization ratio implies that the cardholder does not need maximum utilization of credit to manage his/her expenses. It also will in turn increase the credit score of the cardholder which can result in an increased credit card limit. How to check eligibility for ICICI credit card limit increase?ICICI credit card limit increase is a facility that allows you to enhance your credit limit on your existing ICICI credit card.
