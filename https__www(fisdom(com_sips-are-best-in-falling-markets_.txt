Assuming that you have already taken care of any emergency funds and kept them in a liquid fund.  The markets are much like our emotions and trigger our emotions too.  What’s happening around us affects our behavior reactions and actions. More often than not, when emotions are high, we make decisions that we often regret. A good thing to do is to postpone the reaction because the cost of that reaction could be very high.Sir John Templeton, the legendary investor and mutual fund pioneer says,“The time of maximum pessimism is the best time to buy, and the time to maximum optimism is the best time to sell.” Few would disagree with such a sentiment. However, as investors our biggest hurdle is myopia, an overt focus on the short term.While we make SIP investments and commit them to long-term goals and promise to stick to them till the goal is achieved, when the markets turn a bit chaotic, we get all sweaty and hit the redeem instead of the investor hold button.There cannot be a better time than a falling market to invest because all your investments will help you enter the markets at much lower levels than you would otherwise with equity SIP.The next time you hear/ read that the markets have fallen 5%, you should enjoy the thought that you possibly got your SIP entry at a similar discount, and holding your emotions through this period and staying invested will only lead to monumental gains.Join our Fin Insight Community  Mutual Funds  Stocks Vs Equity Mutual Funds – Where Should you Invest? 30 May  5 minutes   Mutual Funds  Understanding CAGR: Compounded Annual Growth Rate Explained 26 May  6 minutes   Mutual Funds  How to Withdraw Money from Mutual Funds: A Guide to Redeeming and Selling Funds Online 26 May  6 minutes   Mutual Funds  Differences between Target Maturity Funds and Fixed Maturity Plans 25 May  6 minutes   Mutual Funds  SEBI Allows Investments in International Funds Again: All You Need to Know 25 May  8 minutes   Mutual Funds  Income Funds – Steady Income Generation with Low to Moderate Risks 14 May  7 minutes   Mutual Funds  Flexicap vs Multicap Funds – Understanding the Differences and Making the Right Choice 14 May  7 minutes   Mutual Funds  Asset Allocation Funds – A Diversified Investment Strategy for Balanced Returns 14 May  6 minutes   Mutual Funds  Credit Risk Funds – Understanding the Risks and Rewards of High-Yield Debt 13 May  8 minutes   Mutual Funds  Active vs. Passive vs. Balanced Funds: Which is Right for You? 13 May  9 minutes   Mutual Funds  Growth Funds – Investing in High-Potential Companies for Long-Term Capital Appreciation 13 May  8 minutes   Mutual Funds  PSU Debt Fund – A Safe Haven for Conservative Investors 13 May  10 minutes
