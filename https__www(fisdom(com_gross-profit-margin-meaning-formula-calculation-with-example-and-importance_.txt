This gross profit is then expressed in terms of percentage by dividing it by the revenues or sales for the period to derive the gross profit margin. Unlike net profit, gross profit does not include additional costs or expenses of a business like general administrative expenses, sales, and distribution expenses, etc. Rather it covers only the expenses incurred by a company to produce or acquire the products or services that it sells. This includes the direct costs of materials, labor, and overhead expenses that are directly tied to the production or acquisition of the goods or services. What is the formula to calculate gross profit margin?The first step to calculating gross profit margin is to calculate the gross profit of a company. The formula to calculate the gross profit of a company is given below,Gross profit = Revenue or Sales – Cost of goods soldIn the above formula, revenue represents the total amount of money earned from selling goods or services. The cost of goods sold represents the direct costs associated with producing or acquiring those goods or services.The formula to calculate the gross profit margin is, Gross Profit = (Revenue – Cost of Goods Sold) / Revenue x 100 or,Gross Profit Margin = Gross Profit / Revenue x 100The above formula is explained through an example. Company A has revenues of Rs. 1,00,000 and a cost of goods sold (COGS) of Rs. 60,000.

The importance of the same is highlighted here.Measure of profitabilityGross profit margin is a direct measure of the profitability of a business and its ability to generate profits over its cost of production and sales. When a company has a higher gross profit margin, it indicates a higher profit made through each sale whereas a lower gross profit margin needs deeper introspection in terms of higher costs or poor pricing policy, or other factors.Evaluation of effective pricing policyThis can be a crucial parameter in deciding the pricing policy of a business. A company with a higher gross profit margin can indicate a better pricing policy than its peers or the advantage of lower costs. On the other hand, a business with a poor GPM can indicate loopholes in its pricing policy and its need for revision. Comparing the performance of the businessGross profit margin is also one of the many indicators of comparing the financial health and performance of the business with itself as well as with its peers in the industry. Such exercise can help in understanding key areas that need management attention or revision of organisational policies that can lead to better efficiency and help the business gain a competitive advantage. Efficiency in cost managementThe gross profit margin is also a strong indicator of a company’s ability to manage its cost.
