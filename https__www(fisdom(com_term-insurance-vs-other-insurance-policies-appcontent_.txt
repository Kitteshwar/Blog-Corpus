An unforeseen situation can occur at any place to anyone at any point in time. To plan for such situations, there are various types of insurance like health, term, life insurance, etc. These three–term insurance, life insurance and health insurance are the ones that provide assistance for human health or life loss. Let us explore these three in detail: 1. Term insurance policy: Term insurance is for a fixed term such as 20/40 years. Through this insurance format, insurance companies provide financial support to the nominee of the policyholders in the event of the policyholder’s death within the policy term. Term insurance is also known as a pure protection plan since it provides protection to the life insured’s family in case of his/her death. It allows no claim to the money in case the person survives the policy tenure.Watch this video on YouTube2. Life insurance policy: Under this, policyholders receive benefits at the time of policy maturity. Irrespective of whether the person is alive or attains death, the payment is guaranteed under this policy format. The policy holder can decide on the policy term and if he/she does not survive the term, the money is given to the nominee.3. Health insurance policy: This policy assists policy holders by covering for medical expenses. All medical claims of the policyholder and/or their family members are covered under a health insurance policy.

The policyholder can also decide the format in which coverage amount is to be received.In case of the demise of the policyholder during the policy term, the insurance company gives out the coverage amount to the beneficiary of the policy.If the policyholder survives the policy term, the coverage ends and there is generally no financial payment from the insurance company. However, if the policy includes survival benefits, the policyholder gets a lump sum amount at policy maturity.At the end of the policy term, depending on individual choice, the policy can be renewed if the policy allows renewal. Generally, renewals are only allowed until the time the policyholder reaches the maximum age as defined by the insurer. In case of renewals, the premium is recalculated for the renewed term.Term Insurance vs Life Insurance vs Health InsuranceDifference between these three insurance policies are as below:BenefitTerm InsuranceLife InsuranceHealth Insurance Coverage Term insurance provides cover for the premature death of the policyholder during the policy term. Life insurance coverage is available during policy maturity. Provides for the medical costs that may be incurred within the policy tenure. DurationBetween 10 to 30/45 yearsBetween 5 to 30 yearsBetween  5 to 10 yearsPremiumCheapest among all the insurance types with low and affordable premiumPremium costs are higher as compared to term insurancePremium increases as the age of the policy holder increasesDeath benefits Payable – Only if the policy holder attains death during the policy term.Payable – if the policy holder attains death or at the time of policy maturity, depending on the plan chosen.No death benefits in case of the policyholder’s death during the policy term. Tax Deductions available Premium paid can be claimed under Sec 80CPremium paid can be claimed under Sec 80CPremium paid can be claimed under Sec 80D of IT ActCommon benefits of these insurance policiesSome of the common benefits offered by all these insurance formats are:Payment processAll three allow one time premium payment or regular, depending on individual preference.
