Thus, when CRR rises, there is a negative impact on the stock markets. This is usually followed by a decline in stock prices. As stock prices of companies decline, it can result in a slowdown in many sectors, like engineering, manufacturing, banking, etc. Therefore, the stock market may face a hit with an increase in the CRR.Real estateIf there is an increase in CRR, there is lesser liquidity of funds in the market. Thus, investors may not look forward to investing in real estate or borrow a home loan due to the high interest rates. Additionally, the construction sector may see a slowdown since multiple construction companies can face scarcity of work due to lower demand. In such situations, construction companies will be reluctant to take on more work since it can increase their overhead costs.InvestmentsHigher investments mean additional funds being injected into the economy. When CRR increases, there may be a shortage of fund availability for investment. This can result in slack and a slowdown in investments. Hence, the economy itself starts slowing down as a result.Exports and importsA rise in CRR often means higher interest rates. This limits the production from industries with regards to products and services. As industries deploy lesser resources into production and expansion plans, it can result in people looking for foreign goods and services to fulfil their needs. Thus, imports rise and exports decrease. This results in a downward pressure on a country’s GDP.Equity and commodity marketWhen CRR rises, there is lesser investment in the equity market. This affects the commodity market due to the limited availability of disposable funds for investments. General publicAn increase in CRR results in higher interest rates.

In the case of floating interest rates, one can expect the loan EMI or the loan tenure to increase following a rise in CRR.ConclusionInvestors should keep themselves aware of how CRR works and how it affects interest rates, inflation, and other monetary factors.
