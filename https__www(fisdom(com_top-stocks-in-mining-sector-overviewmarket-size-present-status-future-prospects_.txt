One of the leading mine-producing states in the country is Odisha, contributing close to one-fourth of the national output.Here’s a detailed look at the mining industry in India, including some of the top listed companies in this sector.About the Indian mining sectorHere are some key statistics on the mining sector:India is one of the top producers of iron ore and bauxite. This accounts for close to 2.5% of the country’s GDP. The national coal production is said to be 7.6% of the global levels. The country also contributes about 10% to global proved coal reserves. Since India’s mining sector is very diverse, the country’s largest mines are essentially state-owned. Private companies owning mines in the country are market leaders in various manufacturing segments. The government offers mineral concessions to Indian nationals, and companies incorporated in India. Further, the country allows 100% foreign direct investment in such companies. Coal India, a state-owned company, is known for being the largest employer in the mining sector. It has also been listed among the world’s top ten mining companies, with a primary focus on mining production and operations. Growth drivers for the mining sectorIndia has a significant number of opportunities in the mining of iron ore, bauxite and coal. Experts even see possibilities for future sub-surface deposit discoveries. With an increased focus on infrastructure in the country, there are many lucrative business opportunities for the consumption of steel, zinc, and aluminium.The country’s real estate sector is also a major consumer of iron and steel. As the demand for these is likely to see continued growth, the mining sector will see a significant boost too.Since mining has been known to cause harm to the country’s environment and impact certain communities, it was restricted to a few companies. Following the COVID-19 pandemic, the Indian government, as part of its revival measures for the mining sector, permitted non-steel and non-power companies to carry out commercial coal mining. This decision was aimed at boosting domestic coal production, minimising imports, and aiding all other user industries. This move was, however. withdrawn later. This is because the decision triggered a series of debates supporting clean energy. Key challenges faced by the mining industryAlthough the mining sector in India has enjoyed an annual growth rate of 4 to 5% over the last three decades, the industry has seen significant ‘growth at all cost’ over the years. Few of the hurdles in the sector’s growth are:Due to growing demand, India’s coal imports are also seen to be constantly rising, despite large coal reserves in the country.The industry has also seen workers not being given their legitimate dues. Issues like unscientific mining methods, slaughter mining, and lack of focus on conservation have also marred the industry’s image over the years. Some of the other issues in many private collieries include forced labour, musclemen protecting mine owner interests, corruption, inaccurate records, extended hours of work without pay, and lack of proper safety measures.While many of these areas have been addressed in the last few years, many problems continue to pose a threat to the industry’s growth. Since mining is crucial to the nation’s development, accentuated efforts are required in some of these problem areas. Top stocks in the Indian mining sector by market capitalizationCoal India Ltd.Coal India Ltd. is India’s largest and also one of the top global coal-producing companies.
