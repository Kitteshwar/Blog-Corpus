Within a matter of one year, most banks came on board with the immense benefits witnessed from UPI. This resulted in most banks having their own version of the UPI app. Under the umbrella of a single platform, UPI merges different banking services and features. A UPI ID and PIN are the only requirements for sending and receiving money. With UPI, a user can make real-time bank-to-bank transfers or payments with a mobile number or virtual payment address (UPI ID).Who initiated UPI?UPI was initiated and launched by the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) in association with the Reserve Bank of India and Indian Banks Association (IBA). NPCI is responsible for the management of RuPay payments infrastructure, i.e. similar to Visa and MasterCard. It facilitates interconnection and transfer of funds between different banks. Immediate Payments Service (IMPS) was also an initiative of NPCI. UPI is known as an advancement of IMPS.How does UPI work?UPI is a convenient digital payment mode that allows users to transfer funds from one bank to another without requiring an account number, bank name, account type, or IFSC.Here are the requirements for using UPI to make a fund transfer:Bank accountActive mobile number (linked to user’s bank account)SmartphoneInternet connectionRegistration on UPI and mPIN generationA UPI ID is a unique identification associated with a bank account.

In the past, there was a nominal charge for using UPI, fixed Rs. 0.50 per transaction. However, the government did away with all charges with an objective to promote digital transactions. Many banks have started promoting their UPI app and therefore they do not charge fees from users. There are also no charges to download the UPI-based app from online platforms.Important things to know about UPIUPI is a smartphone-friendly application. Here are some important aspects that users should know about UPI before using it:To use UPI, users need to set up a VPA- Virtual Payment Address or handle and link their bank accounts for the same.

This may be revised in the future. Many banks may have their internal caps, too.How secure are UPI transactionsUPI transactions are secure as they use two-factor authentication, and sensitive information such as the UPI PIN is not stored on the device or shared with the merchant. UPI also uses encryption to secure the data transmitted during the transaction, and transactions can only be completed with a valid UPI PIN.Furthermore, UPI transactions are monitored by the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) and are subject to regulatory oversight. Any suspicious activity is flagged and investigated.What is UPI 2.0?UPI 2.0 is an upgraded version of the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) system introduced by the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI).
