The Supreme Court gave its ruling on the petition for an extension of the moratorium period and waiver of interest during the moratorium period.What does the ruling say? If you remember the RBI allowed a moratorium on all loans between March -Aug last year. Though the moratorium was meant to allow time and relief to the borrowers, they were charged extra interest (interest on interest) during the moratorium.In Oct 2020, the Union Government announced they would absorb the compound interest cost on all loans (like home, auto, education, personal loans including MSME loans) below Rs 2cr.This facility was allowed even to those borrowers who hadn’t availed moratorium. (?Remember getting some amount credited to your loan and credit card account?) But some sections who were not satisfied with this approached the apex court for a complete waiver of interest and an extension of the moratorium.The SC gave a ruling this week which saidThe compound interest benefit should be allowed for all loans irrespective of the amount.Complete waiver of interest would hurt the banks who have to pay interest to their depositors.No further extension of the moratorium period and those who don’t pay EMIs beyond this period can be classified as Non Performing Assets.How does this ruling affect you and me?If you have loans over Rs 2cr expect some relief soon. However, this time it isn’t clear if the govt will bear the burden or pass it over to the banks and NBFCs to make the payment.Also, if you haven’t paid your loan EMIs beyond Aug 2020, your account may be classified as a Non-performing asset which can cause a big dent in your credit score.You Ask – We AnswerHow much premium would I have to pay for a term insurance policy? – Premchand PandeyIn the last issue of our newsletter, we spoke about why the term insurance policies are going higher from April onwards.Term insurance policies are meant to insure your life for a fixed period of time.
