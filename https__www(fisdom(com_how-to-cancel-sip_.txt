This is on account of many factors like increased investor awareness, increased returns over some time, ease of access to mutual funds, and the availability of investment options for every investor class.There are two modes of investment in mutual funds through lumpsum mode or SIPs. SIPs are Systematic Investment Plans where the investor has the option to invest in the selected mutual fund at regular intervals like a weekly basis, monthly basis, quarterly basis, or annual basis. The amount of investment can be as low as Rs. 500 or Rs. 100 in case of certain funds. Investors have to set a mandate with their bank account that will auto-debit the amount of SIP at regular intervals until the time that such SIP is stopped by the investor.   Table of Contents  hide   1 What is SIP?   2 Reasons to stop SIP   3 Ways to stop SIP   4 How to cancel SIP through Fisdom App   5 How to stop SIP through Fisdom App   6 Conclusion   7 FAQs Reasons to stop SIPIt is not advisable to stop SIPs as they provide a cheaper source of investment option at reduced risks. It is also an ideal option for investors that have a limited investment budget and long-term investment goals. However, there may be several cases when the investor has to choose to stop their SIPs and move away from their investment. Some of such reasons for stopping the SIP are mentioned below.Market volatilityMarket volatility is a big factor for the exit of investors especially, risk-averse investors. Many investors redeem their investment in the fund if the NAV of such a fund reduces drastically and if the performance of the fund is too volatile on account of market volatility. Ideally, such volatility is part of mutual fund investments and should not be a reason for cancelling the SIPs.Consistent poor performance of the fundAnother important contributing factor for cancelling SIP is the poor performance of the fund. If the performance of the fund is consistently poor and fails to provide cost-effective returns to the investors, it often leads the investors to turn away from the fund and cancel their SIPs.Change in asset allocation or objective of the fund A change in the fund’s asset allocation or the objective of the fund can also result in the investors cancelling their SIPs. This may no longer match with the objectives or the risk parameters of the investor leading them to exit the fund by cancelling their SIPs.Other reasonsApart from the reasons mentioned above, some other contributing reasons for cancelling SIPs can be,Realization of investment objective Once the investment objective or goals of the investor are achieved, the investor may no longer need to stay invested in the fund.

This can be a strong reason for cancelling a SIP. Change in fund managerChange in the fund manager may not always be a reason for cancelling the SIPs. However, if the new fund manager has new fund strategies that are not in line with the investor’s objectives or goals or risk factors, they may opt to cancel their SIP in such a fund.Any financial emergency of the investorAnother important factor that may warrant cancelling of the SIP may be any financial emergencies of the investor.
