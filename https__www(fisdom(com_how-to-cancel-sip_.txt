This is on account of many factors like increased investor awareness, increased returns over some time, ease of access to mutual funds, and the availability of investment options for every investor class.There are two modes of investment in mutual funds through lumpsum mode or SIPs. SIPs are Systematic Investment Plans where the investor has the option to invest in the selected mutual fund at regular intervals like a weekly basis, monthly basis, quarterly basis, or annual basis. The amount of investment can be as low as Rs. 500 or Rs. 100 in case of certain funds. Investors have to set a mandate with their bank account that will auto-debit the amount of SIP at regular intervals until the time that such SIP is stopped by the investor.   Table of Contents  hide   1 What is SIP?   2 Reasons to stop SIP   3 Ways to stop SIP   4 How to cancel SIP through Fisdom App   5 How to stop SIP through Fisdom App   6 Conclusion   7 FAQs Reasons to stop SIPIt is not advisable to stop SIPs as they provide a cheaper source of investment option at reduced risks.
