A taxpayer’s tax liability is determined basis the income earned. Further, an individual can claim income tax refunds if his/her returns demonstrate that excess tax has been paid in a given year. In this article, we will mainly focus on individual taxpayers.The Income Tax Department of India requires taxpayers to file an Income Tax Return form so that they can have sufficient information about taxpayers’ earnings and the taxes owed in the previous financial year. A taxpayer must mandatorily file income tax returns if his/her income is above the basic exemption limit, as per existing Indian tax norms. Non-submission or delay in ITR submission attracts penalties. So, how can one ensure successful ITR filing?Here are some points to keep in mind for successful tax filing for individuals.1. Select the correct ITR formSelecting the correct applicable ITR form is crucial, and this depends on various factors, like the taxpayer’s income source, residential status, etc. For example, Form ITR-1 can be used only by a resident individual with net income from salary of up to Rs. 50 lakhs, single house/property and income from other sources. A non-resident taxpayer or someone who is not an ordinary resident or those with capital gains cannot use this form for ITR.2. Cautiously using prefilled ITR formsSince ITR forms can now automatically import information like personal details, salary income, interest income, dividend income, etc. of the taxpayer, the pre-filled forms are available to be used. However, it is important for individuals to verify this information and make changes to income if relevant information is not auto-populated. 3. Select between new and old tax regimes as per benefitsA new optional tax regime was introduced as part of the Finance Act, 2020. Taxpayers can use this by foregoing certain prescribed exemptions and deductions in the old regime. Hence, one can choose either the old or new tax regime while filing tax returns. Pro-tipIf you are a salaried taxpayer, you can change the regime while filing ITR even if you have already declared a different regime to your employer at the start of the financial year.4. Use Form 26AS for prepaid tax verification Taxpayers must verify any information on prepaid taxes such as advance tax, TDS or tax deducted at the source, and self-assessment tax using Form 26AS. In case of any misinformation in the form, one must notify the employer or other payers to make relevant corrections. This will ensure successful income tax return filing.5. Check exempt income‘Schedule EI’ must be used by taxpayers to report any exempt income like agricultural income, income of minor child, income not eligible for tax under the Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement, etc.6. Avoid duplication due to change of employmentIf a salaried taxpayer changes jobs in between a financial year and has furnished relevant salary details to the new employer, he/she can get a consolidated Form 16 and 12BA from the current employer for filing ITR. This can help in avoiding any shortfall in TDS, duplication of exemption and deduction benefits, etc. 7. Know the mandatory disclosures Below-mentioned disclosures of investments and assets must be furnished in ITR:Details of all accounts held with Indian banksDetails of any unlisted equity shares heldInformation on any directorship position held in any Indian or foreign companies.If an individual’s total income is above Rs. 50 lakhs, details of specified assets like land, movable assets, financial assets, etc. and liabilities must be disclosedResident individuals must furnish details of any assets held in foreign countries8.
