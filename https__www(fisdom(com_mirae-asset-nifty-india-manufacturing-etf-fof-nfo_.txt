These funds are then pooled to buy the shares or other securities as per the fund’s mandate or the guidelines based on which the fund is launched. NFOs are like IPOs where all the relevant details of the funds are provided at the time of their launch and the units of the fund are usually set at Rs. 10 per unit for a subscription. SEBI guidelines allow the NFOs to be active for a maximum period of 30 days following which the units of the fund are traded based on their daily NAVWhat are the types of NFOs?NFOs, at the time of their launch, are launched in two categories namely close-ended funds and open-ended funds. The details of each type of fund are mentioned below.Open-ended fundsThe majority of mutual funds are launched as open-ended funds. These types of funds allow the investors to enter or exit the fund at any time based on various factors like profit opportunity, goal realization, minimizing losses, etc. the units of the fund, therefore, keep fluctuating based on the demand-supply functions of the market. Investors can subscribe to the fund at the nominal rate (usually Rs. 10 per unit) during the NFO period. After the NFO period, when the units are traded based on the daily NAV, the investors stand to gain huge capital gains depending on the performance of the fund.Close-ended fundsClose-ended funds, on the other hand, do not allow the investors to subscribe to the fund after the NFO period is closed. The number of units of the fund is fixed unlike open-ended funds and the fund is for a definite period of time, i.e. with fixed maturity. Investors can exit the fund after the completion of such a period. Close-ended funds can be listed on recognized stock exchanges to increase their liquidity and can be traded even after the closure of the NFO period. The NAV of the fund is determined based on the demand-supply function of its units.What are the points to consider before investing in NFOs?Investing in NFOs is a very good opportunity to maximize the returns as the units can be subscribed at nominal rates and the returns are potentially higher based on the prevailing NAV at the time of redemption. However, there are several points that need to be considered while subscribing to an NFO. Some of such points are highlighted below. Lack of track recordNFOs are offered for the new mutual fund so no proven track record can be reviewed by investors to make an informed investment decision. The investors have to therefore rely on the reputation of the AMC and other details mentioned in the NFO to make an investment decision. Higher expense ratioNFOs need a good amount of publicity to make the investors aware of the fund and the investment opportunity. It is therefore essential for the investors to check the expense ratio of the fund and ensure that it does not outweigh the net gains. Check if the fund is in correlation to the existing portfolioRecently there have been many NFOs in the market that investors can choose from. However, while selecting the fund the investors must check if the fund is not similar to an existing fund in their portfolio. For example, if the fund is a large-cap fund and the investor already has one or two similar funds in their portfolio, investing in another will not add much value to the net returns or the diversification of the portfolio. On the other hand, many NFOs can be sector-specific or country-specific. In such a case, investors have to check if the fund is in line with other factors like their risk-return profile and investment goals. Review the SID carefullyReviewing the SID (Scheme Information Document) is a crucial step that should not be missed by investors while investing in NFOs. It contains all the relevant information about the fund managers, their qualifications, and experience which is crucial for the funds’ performance. Other relevant information includes the investment profile of the fund, target sectors or securities, benchmark index, asset allocation ratio, etc. This helps the investors understand the returns expectation of the fund as well as the target investments where the fund will invest the pooled funds. Investors having a risk-return profile in line with that of the fund can thus invest in such funds. How to invest in NFOs? Investment in NFOs can be done through two main routes i.e., the online or offline modes. The details of the same are mentioned below.Online modeThe online mode of investment is suitable for investors already having a Demat account and a trading account. Investors can simply select the NFO and invest by selecting the number of units to invest and paying for the same through online payment modes available on the platform.  Offline modeThe offline mode of investment in NFOs is through registered brokers and distributors. Investors can contact their brokers and distributors providing them with the details of the amount to be invested and they can invest in the selected NFOs on their behalf. Investors can make hassle-free investments through such modes as all the necessary forms to be filled and the formalities to be met are looked after by these entities giving investors the benefit of ease of investment. The charges for such services are nominal when compared to the potentially high returns.Head over to the Fisdom  App to invest in this NFO.   New Fund Offers(NFO)  ICICI Pru Innovation Fund NFO 12 Apr  5 minutes   New Fund Offers(NFO)  TAX SAVER FUND White Oak  NFO – 2023 09 Jan  9 minutes   New Fund Offers(NFO)  [Updated[ ICICI Pru Tpt & Logistics Fund -202 01 Dec  9 minutes   New Fund Offers(NFO)  HDFC Business Cycle NFO Review 22 Nov  8 minutes   New Fund Offers(NFO)  Baroda BNP Multi Asset NFO Review 22 Nov  8 minutes   New Fund Offers(NFO)  IDFC Tpt & Logistics Fund 06 Oct  10 minutes   New Fund Offers(NFO)  Union Retirement Fund NFO Review 15 Sep  8 minutes   New Fund Offers(NFO)  Kotak Business Cycles Fund NFO 15 Sep  7 minutes   New Fund Offers(NFO)  IDFC Nifty100 Low Volatility 30 Index Fund 15 Sep  7 minutes   New Fund Offers(NFO)  ICICI Prudential Nifty50 Equal Weight Index Fund NFO 15 Sep  7 minutes   New Fund Offers(NFO)  Edelweiss Gold & Silver ETF FOF NFO 02 Sep  7 minutes   New Fund Offers(NFO)  ICICI Pru PSU Equity Fund NFO 02 Sep  7 minutes
