India’s Domestic Discourse Attract Cautious Global GaugeThe sharpest economic contraction on record and across the world has investors worried about India’s promise as an investment-favorite destination. Economic agencies across borders slash GDP estimates to reflect current economic climate more correctly, and bank on more govt.-induced policies/reforms to clot bleeding economy!Covid 19, now in 2020, and in 2021 in 3 months, continues to be bearer of bad news.

As NPA and credit costs increase, the profitability wound is sure to rupture, adding stress to current conservative credit climate All, but one voice, cheered when the moratorium was announced, and that was the banks. Knowing of the impending doom, in economic contractions, and bending will to satiate central govt. policies, those who lend money are themselves in dire need of it. 3 years later, and banks find themselves 4 years behind!
