Almost one and a half decades ago there was this viral idea that shocked the World. No, it wasn’t reality television but the crazy concept that certain songs that are popular around the World are satanic in Nature. The most disappointing for millennials was the reverse playing, ‘Pokemon’ theme song which sounds naturally disturbing but still not alarming and one that could be ignored as a coincidence. But then we heard Satanic interpretations of a rock ballet which is one of the best songs ever written or performed sounding like a hymn for the Devil when played in reverse. It was the Stairway to Heaven by Led Zeppelin. It’s still a matter of perception. The pessimistic mind will see the Devil hidden within insidious rock music whereas the fairly optimistic person can see that good and bad simply co-exist in reality.So, how is it related to mutual funds?

Harshad Mehta stock scam), many strict rules were imposed on financial products.
