One of the most common types of health insurance is indemnity plans. Given below are a few details of indemnity plans and the target audience for them.

Indemnity plans are based on the same idea. This type of health insurance provides coverage for the actual expenses of hospitalization incurred by the insured person. Policyholders can opt for cashless hospitalization too. In such cases, they will not have to pay any amount (or a minimum fixed amount as per the policy terms of the insurer) at the time of hospital admission. If the policyholder does not opt for cashless hospitalization, then they will have to submit all the necessary documents like medical reports, hospital bills, etc. the compensation for the actual expenses will be based on such documents.  What are the highlights of indemnity based health insurance plans?Indemnity plans provide basic health insurance to the policyholders. The majority of health insurance plans or medical plans currently available in the market are indemnity based plans. Some of the highlights of these plans are mentioned below.a. Reduced premiumsThe premiums to be paid on the indemnity plans are lower as compared to other types of health insurance plans. In most indemnity plans, the policyholder shares a portion of the risk or the cost of treatment and the balance has to be paid by the insurer. This reduces the risk of the insurer and results in a reduction of the premium amount.b. Cheaper hospitalizationThe cost of healthcare in our country is ever increasing. This has further been highlighted by the Covid 19 pandemic where many people could not afford to get adequate medical attention in private hospitals. Health insurance in such cases can be of huge help. It makes private hospitalization cheaper and thus provides better access to good private hospitals. c. Option to choose family floaters and individual plans Indemnity plans are available for individuals or for the entire family. Individual plans have to be bought in the name of the person to be insured. Family floater plans on the other hand can be used to provide health insurance coverage for the entire family and the premium amount will be higher than individual plans after factoring in many factors like the number of persons to be insured, maximum age of the person on the plan, etc. d. Better flexibilityAnother important benefit of indemnity plans is the flexibility to choose the hospital or the doctor to get medical aid. This flexibility ensures that timely medical attention is provided to the insured person and their family members covered under the plan without any unnecessary delay. What are the limitations of indemnity plans?Indemnity plans are the most common type of health insurance plan in India. These plans provide the actual cost of hospitalization to the policyholders thereby easing their financial burden. However, there are certain limitations to the indemnity plans. Some of such limitations are discussed below.The first and foremost limitation of the indemnity plan is the limited coverage that is provided under the plan. These plans do not provide pre hospitalization or post hospitalization expenses. Documentation is another hurdle or limitation that is faced in an indemnity plan. The insured person needs to provide extensive and exact documentation in order to raise a claim under the plan. These documents will be duly verified by the insurers before settling the claimLike any other health plan, there are certain specific exclusions where the insurer is not liable to settle the claims raised. If the insured person or any other person covered under the plan has a specific medical condition, then the claim will not be settled.   Who should go in for indemnity plans?Health insurance is important for every person and their family members. Indemnity plan help in getting compensation for the cost of hospitalization without any pre or post hospitalization expenses. These plans are a good option for people looking for coverage of maximum ailments and illnesses as well as hospitalization expenses at lower premiums. These plans also provide huge flexibility in choosing the hospitals and doctors to get the medical attention. Hence, it can also be useful for people looking for greater flexibility in their health insurance plans. ConclusionGetting a good health insurance plan has become a necessity in todays’ world.
