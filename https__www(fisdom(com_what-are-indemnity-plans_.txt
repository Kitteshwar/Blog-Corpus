Indemnity plans are based on the same idea. This type of health insurance provides coverage for the actual expenses of hospitalization incurred by the insured person. Policyholders can opt for cashless hospitalization too. In such cases, they will not have to pay any amount (or a minimum fixed amount as per the policy terms of the insurer) at the time of hospital admission. If the policyholder does not opt for cashless hospitalization, then they will have to submit all the necessary documents like medical reports, hospital bills, etc. the compensation for the actual expenses will be based on such documents.  What are the highlights of indemnity based health insurance plans?Indemnity plans provide basic health insurance to the policyholders.

Reduced premiumsThe premiums to be paid on the indemnity plans are lower as compared to other types of health insurance plans. In most indemnity plans, the policyholder shares a portion of the risk or the cost of treatment and the balance has to be paid by the insurer. This reduces the risk of the insurer and results in a reduction of the premium amount.b. Cheaper hospitalizationThe cost of healthcare in our country is ever increasing.

Better flexibilityAnother important benefit of indemnity plans is the flexibility to choose the hospital or the doctor to get medical aid. This flexibility ensures that timely medical attention is provided to the insured person and their family members covered under the plan without any unnecessary delay. What are the limitations of indemnity plans?Indemnity plans are the most common type of health insurance plan in India.
