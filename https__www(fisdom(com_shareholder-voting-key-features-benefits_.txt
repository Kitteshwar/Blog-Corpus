With shareholder voting, various aspects like corporate policies, the election of board members, financial investment, operational decisions, approval of dividends, mergers, etc can be influenced by existing shareholders. Key featuresIn shareholder voting, a shareholder gets the number of votes in direct proportion to his/her investment or the number of shares held.Thus, if a shareholder owns more than 50% of a company’s shares, they can enjoy a majority vote or a controlling stake in the company. This allows the shareholder to significantly impact the company’s crucial decisions including its policies.With shareholder voting, shareholders can vote on many aspects pertaining to the corporation. This can include its day-to-day operations or even appointing the board of directors who look after the company’s day-to-day operations.Benefits of shareholder voting rightsShareholders can use their voting rights to influence the choice of the organization’s directors. Investors may cast a vote in decisions such as a proposed investment opportunity. Investors can also use their vote to be in favour or against decisions like stock split or bonus issues and maximise their benefits. Shareholders can use their voting right to indirectly impact the company’s profitability and influence its investment success.
