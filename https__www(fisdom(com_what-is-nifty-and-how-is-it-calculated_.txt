This is mainly due to a lack of investor awareness and also lack of knowledge of the investment products that offer good returns at a relatively lower risk. Informed investors and traders, however, can gain huge returns by careful research and analysis of the two national indices in India namely, Nifty and Sensex. What is Nifty?Nifty 50 is the market index of the National Stock Exchange and is owned by India Index Services and Products (IISL). This index is formed of the top 50 equity stocks of those companies that are listed in the country in terms of liquidity and market capitalization. These companies are from various sectors in India like pharmaceuticals, consumer goods, financial services, energy, telecommunications, cement, information technology, automobiles, and more. Nifty 50 is used for various purposes like benchmarking fund portfolios, index-based derivatives, and index funds.Eligibility for listing in NiftyInvestors have the benefit of choosing top stocks for investment and trading to maximize their returns. Securities listed on Nifty are among the top-rated companies hence, there are strict eligibility criteria for the companies to be listed on Nifty.

The specific eligibility criteria required by the companies to be listed on Nifty are discussed below.The first and foremost condition is that the company has to be an Indian Company and registered on the National Stock exchangeThe stock of such a company should be highly liquid. To measure the liquidity of the stock of any company, the average impact cost is considered. This impact cost refers to the trading price of single security in relation to the index’s weight to the company’s market capitalization.The eligibility criterion in this regard requires the company’s impact cost to be less than or equal to 0.50% for six months while 90% of the observations made on a portfolio of Rs.10 crores.The trading frequency of the company is also considered and such frequency has to be 100%Another important factor is the free-floating average market capitalization. It has to be 1.5 times higher than the smallest company on the index.Nifty 50 can also include shares of the company that has Differential Voting Rights (DVR) as eligible companies on the index.Any changes in the structure of the listed companies (mergers, demergers, mandatory delisting, suspensions, etc.) also prompt a revision in the Nifty 50. Nifty carries a thorough quarterly review of the companies listed on the index to ensure that they comply with all the regulations set by SEBI and other mandatory norms required in this regard.How is Nifty Calculated?The calculation of Nifty 50 indices is based on the float-adjusted and market capitalization method.
