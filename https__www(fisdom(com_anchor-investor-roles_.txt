The essence of anchor investors is to create a buzz for the IPO and show credibility and support for the issue. The extent of investment made by anchor investors indicates the quality of the IPO and the reputation of the company coming out with the said IPO. Minimum investment and other rules for anchor investors to invest in IPOThe investment by anchor investors is subject to certain conditions that have been laid down by SEBI. These rules are highlighted hereunder. Anchor investors have to invest a minimum of Rs. 10 crore in the IPO.Mutual funds have the reservation of one-third portion in the anchor investor category.Anchor investors have the allocation of 30% of the total IPO.Among the QIB (Qualified Institutional Buyers) category, anchor investors have a reservation of up to 60% of the issue size.They are offered to invest in the IPO and gets confirmed allotment a day before the IPO is open for public subscription.Anchor investors have a lock-in period of 30 days during which they cannot sell their shares or offload their holdings.

When the offer size is more than Rs. 250 crores the maximum number of anchor investors can be up to 25.The shares allotted to the anchor investors are at a fixed price within the price band (usually at the upper end of the price band). If during the book-building process, the price of the shares is determined to be higher, anchor investors will have to pay the difference between such prices. However, if the price is determined to be lower than the price at which shares are allotted to the anchor investors, they will not get the difference back.Role of anchor investors in IPOThe role of anchor investors in an IPO is explained below.Anchor investors are among the core investors of any IPO.Investment by anchor investors is crucial in boosting the confidence of mainly retail investors.Retail investors usually look for online reviews before investing in an IPO. Anchor investors, however, have a thorough and detailed analysis of the company and the IPO itself thereby enabling a professional and practical approach towards it.By investing in the IPO, anchor investors provide authenticity to such IPO and also aid in better price discovery.What is anchor investors’ lock-in period in IPOs?As mentioned above, the investment made by the anchor investors is subject to a lock-in period of 30 days. This lock-in period was put in to avoid the huge market volatility if the anchor investors were to offload their holdings to make listing gains from the open market. However, it was observed that after the completion of 30 days, when the anchor investors pooled out their money by selling their stake in the open market, it created a huge slump in the share prices of such a company, ultimately creating a panic among the retail investors and impacting their interests. Therefore, in order to safeguard their interest, SEBI laid out revised regulations according to which after the completion of 30 days, anchor investors can sell only half of their stake and the remaining half can be offloaded after the completion of 90 days. These regulations from SEBI are aimed to bring better stability to the share prices of such stocks and the market as a whole. ConclusionAnchor investors as their name suggest, provide stability to an IPO and generate public interest in it. They are, therefore, given the priority chance to subscribe to the shares of the company at a fixed price instead of bidding within the price band which is the case for retail investors. Retail investors should therefore focus on the list of anchor investors to know how much they are favoured by them to ascertain the quality iof the IPO and if they are a good addition to their investment portfolio.  FAQs1.
