The portfolio of a passive fund replicates a market index like Nifty, Sensex, etc. The securities and the proportion of investment in each is the same as the index that the fund tracks.In passive funds, there is no need for the fund manager to actively pick stocks for investment. This makes passive funds far easier to invest in and track than active funds. Investors invest in passive funds to fetch returns that are in line with the market performance. These funds are normally low cost since they don’t involve costs related to selection of stocks, researching, or frequent buying and selling of securities.Types of Passive FundsHere are some of the commonly available passive funds:Index FundsIndex Funds are passive funds that construct the investment portfolio using a market index as reference. Index funds are called passively managed funds, since they passively track the performance of an index. An index fund’s performance therefore depends on the performance of the chosen index. They invest in shares in a similar proportion as a particular index. Unlike actively managed funds, index funds do not aim to outperform the market. The aim of index funds is to replicate the performance of an index. ETFsETFs or Exchange-Traded Funds are listed and traded on stock exchanges, just like shares. These funds pool money from investors and invest in diversified securities including equities, bonds, commodities, etc while tracking an underlying index.An ETF tracks an index like the Sensex or Nifty by investing in securities in the same weights as the index. ETFs are tradeable in the market. An investor needs to have a demat account for investing in an ETF and executing any buy or sell transactions.Fund of FundsFund of funds invest in other mutual funds. Here, the fund manager is responsible for a portfolio of mutual funds that is designed to match the investor profile. Fund managers may choose to invest in the fund of the same fund house or different fund houses. Investment in a fund of funds helps in portfolio diversification as different mutual funds may comprise different assets, sectors, markets, or industries. Smart BetaSmart beta funds are similar to the ETF model of investment. These funds combine the benefits of passively managed funds with active investment selection based on certain criteria. This allows the funds to generate higher returns while working on a low-cost model Smart Beta funds are inclined towards both actively managed funds and passively managed funds. These track an underlying index for performance and also alter the portfolio as per market movements. Like ETFs, these funds are also free from the fund manager bias. Best Passive Funds in India1.Nifty Index FundsMentioned below are some top Nifty index funds in India:L&T Nifty 50 Index Fund – Growth – Direct PlanAbout the fundL&T Nifty 50 Index Fund belongs to L&T Mutual Fund umbrella.
