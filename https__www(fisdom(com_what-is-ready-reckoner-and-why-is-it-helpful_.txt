MarishaBhattWritten by - Marisha BhattSeptember 7, 2022  6 minutes  India is the second-largest in the world in terms of population.

The government in every budget brings various amendments to the tax laws to accommodate the changing needs of the country and benefit the taxpayers. This makes our tax laws one of the most complex in the world and the majority of the population simply evades paying tax citing its complexity or finding various loopholes to avoid any tax liability. The Income Tax Act, of 1961 has classified the income earned by taxpayers into various categories and has also notified various ITRs specific to the type of income.    Table of Contents  hide   1 What is ready reckoner and why is it helpful?   2 What is an ITR and when to file it?   3 Income Tax changes in Budget 2023 – watch YouTube video for details   4 Which ITR is applicable for different incomes?   5 Conclusion   6 FAQs Given below is a brief snapshot of the various income heads under the Income Tax Act and the relevant ITRs.What is ready reckoner and why is it helpful?We all have heard of ready reckoners for income tax but what does it exactly mean?
