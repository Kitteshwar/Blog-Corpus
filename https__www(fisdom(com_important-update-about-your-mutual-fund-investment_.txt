And some other minor changes. TejeshKumarWritten by - Tejesh KumarNovember 18, 2020  2 minutes  This is to inform you that starting November 17, 2020, the Reserve Bank of India has placed Lakshmi Vilas Bank (LVB) under a moratorium for a month, capping withdrawals at Rs. 25,000 per depositor. Please note, your investments are with Mutual Fund Companies and not with LVB hence this moratorium will not impact your mutual fund investments in any manner. However, your access to the money redeemed to your LVB account may get blocked during this period due to the capped withdrawal limit.  Hence, to ensure your money does not get withheld — we’ve disabled redemptions to LVB accounts for the time being and have come up with an alternate process for the same. Here’s what you need to do should you wish to place a redemption request:Send an email to lvbredemption@fisdom.com with details of the fund name, the redemption amount along with the alternate bank account* details as mentioned below:Bank Name Account Number IFSC Code Attach Bank Proof (either canceled cheque or passbook photocopy or one month’s bank statement)Upon receiving your alternate bank details and your redemption request, our Operations Team will take it forward and we will notify you once the redemption order is placed. You will receive the redemption amount in your alternate bank account within 4-5 working days.We’ve taken this measure to ensure we continue to serve you in a way that makes your investments 24/7 reliable and seamless. Should you need any further assistance, please call us on +917829228886 .Cheers,Team fisdom  Mutual Funds  Stocks Vs Equity Mutual Funds – Where Should you Invest? 30 May  5 minutes   Mutual Funds  Understanding CAGR: Compounded Annual Growth Rate Explained 26 May  6 minutes   Mutual Funds  How to Withdraw Money from Mutual Funds: A Guide to Redeeming and Selling Funds Online 26 May  6 minutes   Mutual Funds  Differences between Target Maturity Funds and Fixed Maturity Plans 25 May  6 minutes   Mutual Funds  SEBI Allows Investments in International Funds Again: All You Need to Know 25 May  8 minutes   Mutual Funds  Income Funds – Steady Income Generation with Low to Moderate Risks 14 May  7 minutes   Mutual Funds  Asset Allocation Funds – A Diversified Investment Strategy for Balanced Returns 14 May  6 minutes   Mutual Funds  Flexicap vs Multicap Funds – Understanding the Differences and Making the Right Choice 14 May  7 minutes   Mutual Funds  Credit Risk Funds – Understanding the Risks and Rewards of High-Yield Debt 13 May  8 minutes   Mutual Funds  Active vs. Passive vs. Balanced Funds: Which is Right for You? 13 May  9 minutes   Mutual Funds  Growth Funds – Investing in High-Potential Companies for Long-Term Capital Appreciation 13 May  8 minutes   Mutual Funds  PSU Debt Fund – A Safe Haven for Conservative Investors 13 May  10 minutes
