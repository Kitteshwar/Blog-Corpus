Suppose the price of a stock is currently Rs. 200. If an investor uses technical analysis, he/she arrives at a conclusion that the price may rise to Rs. 300. So, where did the current price of Rs. 200 arise from? To know this, we need to know about intrinsic value. In the below section, we will discuss the various methods to determine the intrinsic value of a stock.Difference between market value and intrinsic valueA logical question that any investor would ask is whether intrinsic value is the same as market value? The answer is no. These two are different stock valuations that are often confused with another. The table below talks about the difference in brief:ParameterMarket valueIntrinsic valueMeaningCurrent trading price that one pays for buying a stock on an exchange.Estimated real value of the stock based on the company’s financials. Example price of Stock ARs. 10Market value is lower than intrinsic valueRs. 20Intrinsic value is higher than market valueSince the above example states that the intrinsic value of the stock is higher than the current market value, the stock is said to be undervalued and may have a good safety margin. An investor must, therefore, aim to buy this stock.How to determine the intrinsic value of stocks?Intrinsic value of a stock can be calculated using below methods:1. Relative valuationOne of the most preferred valuation methods to determine the intrinsic value of a stock is the Relative Valuation method. Relative Valuation:Determines a company’s intrinsic value using company fundamentals and current market value. Can be used to determine whether a company is under or overvalued as compared to its peers. Used by investors to estimate a company’s market value.Various financial ratios can be used to know how the company is performing. By understanding the ratios, one can gauge the overall health of a company. The three key ratios that are used to calculate a company’s intrinsic value are: Price-Book Value RatioPrice-Earnings Ratio Price-Sales RatioAlternatively, investors can also use the Enterprise Value (EV) ratios to estimate the intrinsic value. These are:EV-Sales EV-EBIDTA (earnings before interest depreciation tax and amortization)Price-Sales ratio.2. Discounted Cashflow Method (DCF)Under this method, Intrinsic Value is the estimated value of a stock determined as per its future cash flows. Since this value is determined as a function of market expectations, it is different from the market price. This method takes the sum of a company’s forecasted future cash flows to estimate its value. To estimate a company’s value as per its ability to gain a cash position, the future cash flows are further discounted with a required rate of return. The formula for calculating intrinsic value using discounted cash flows is:CF1 / (1 + r) + CF2 / (1 + r)^2 + CF3 / (1 + r)^3 + and so onCF1 = Cash flow in year 1CF2 = Cash flow in year 2And so on..Let’s take an example. A company’s financials are as below:Average cash flow = 6% per annum Required rate of return = 4%Most recent cash flow = Rs. 80 lakhsCash flowDiscountingDiscounted cash flowYear 184.8CF/1.0481.53Year 289.88CF/1.04^283.10Year 395.28CF/1.04^384.70Year 4100.99CF/1.04^486.33Year 5107CF/1.04^589.99If the company is expected to be in business till the next 40 years, the total cash flow value at the end of 40 years will be around Rs. 4,844 lakhs.Assuming that it will have 20 lakh shares outstanding, the intrinsic value of its stocks will be:=4,844 / 20= Rs. 242Why should investors know the intrinsic value of a stock?Intrinsic value may sound like a complex terminology, especially to new investors. However, it simply means “pure value”. When an investor estimates the intrinsic value of a stock, he/she is essentially trying to gauge the stock’s value if it is purchased and sold in the present. It is a helpful tool since it provides an immediate estimate of how much a stock is worth right now. An investor can then compare the intrinsic value of the stock to its current price and understand if it can be a good investment. It also helps an investor to gauge the profitability of potential investments by comparing intrinsic values of different stocks.Drawbacks of intrinsic valueHere are some of the drawbacks of intrinsic value that investors should know before using it:One of the drawbacks of using intrinsic value computing methods is that it can be subjective. While using this technique to project cash flows of a company, an investor has to make many assumptions. Hence, the net present value can change drastically due to changes in the underlying assumptions.While estimating the weighted average cost of capital, the underlying factors, such as market risk premium, may be calculated differently. The probability aspect used in these calculations can also be subjective.As they say, the future is always uncertain. Thus, different investors may conclude differently as far as valuing the same asset is concerned. This is because each individual may have a different take on the future. Also, there is no one way to figure out the accurate number out of many calculations.ConclusionIntrinsic value is an important aspect in determining a stock’s value for investment purposes. Since there are many ways in which one can evaluate the true value of a stock, investors must try to use the best method depending on the company’s sector and after considering the unique characteristics of the company.FAQsWhat is the dividend discount method of calculating intrinsic value of stocks?The dividend discount method (DDM) is one of the easiest ways to determine the intrinsic value of a stock.
