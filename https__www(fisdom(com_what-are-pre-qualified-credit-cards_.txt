It is a general search made using the credit information of the customer to ascertain if they can be a potential customer for the card issuing company. Pre-approved credit cards are a relatively more specific search of the potential customers with the credit bureaus. Under the pre-approved credit card offers, the customers meet certain specific criteria of the product, i.e, the credit card. However, it is important to understand that neither a pre-approved credit card nor a pre-qualified credit card comes with the actual card. Customers have to accept the offer by formally applying for the said credit card and subject to the acceptance from the credit card issuer they will get the credit card through registered mail at the address provided by them. Does a pre-qualified credit card affect the credit score?A pre-qualified and pre-approved credit card offer is a general offer that the customer can accept or reject.
