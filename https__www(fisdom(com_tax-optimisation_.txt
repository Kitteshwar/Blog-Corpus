Read on to understand more. In India, tax rules vary by type and tenure of investment products. They are also often tweaked and modified from year to year in Union budgets. As things stand currently, stocks / equity is taxed leniently: 15% if sold within a year and 0% if sold thereafter. All types of bonds (barring a few identified tax free bonds) are taxed at 30% if sold within 3 years or 10% if sold thereafter. This makes tax optimisation an important concern.To minimise your load and ensure tax optimisation, our investment philosophy usually works as follows:Money you need for emergencies or within a few weeks / months is invested into what are called liquid funds. These often yield as much or better than fixed deposits, but are easily breakable without load.Money needed within a year is put into shorter term bond (debt) funds. Most of these do not have loads if you exit more than a month after investing.Money needed over the longer term is put into stocks / equity or longer term debt funds to maximise their returns potential.If you need some money urgently, our algorithms work to sell those products that minimize your tax / load outflow.
