With growth slumping to a multi-year low of 5 percent, efforts are on to spur consumer demand and investment. On top of that, a slowdown in manufacturing and construction is adding to the worry lines. The GDP data is due on November 29. Along with GDP data, Fiscal deficit data and Eight Infrastructure Industries data will be released for the month of October on 29th November.Bottom line:We believe the Markets are likely to remain range-bound in the coming week and look out for positive triggers that will boost investor sentiments. Market participants will continue to track global factors like the US-China trade deal, crude oil price and currency movement. Returns have been concentrated in select index leaders while the broader markets underperformed, this presents an opportunity to benefit from the current market distortions. We believe the Multi-Cap and Mid Cap strategies are ideally positioned to benefit meaningfully from the likely revival while Large Cap funds can be part of any investor’s core portfolio allocation.
