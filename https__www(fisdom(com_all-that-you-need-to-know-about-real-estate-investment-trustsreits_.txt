Historically in India, investors have been investing in real estate by purchasing a property or land via real estate developers and property brokers. In such investments, investors had to rely on long-term market value appreciation of the property to generate a return on investment. This, however, was only possible when real estate markets would be on an upswing. Developers also had to fund projects by sourcing money through loans from banks, PE firms, etc and this usually meant high-interest rates. In 2008, the Security and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) came up with draft guidelines that allowed investors to establish REITs as an asset class. The intent was to make it easier for foreign investors to invest in the Indian real estate market and make funding easily available for local developers. How did REITs evolve?REITs were first introduced in the USA back in the 1960s on similar lines as mutual funds. These were initiated to boost real estate development through existing investments from investors who were interested in real estate exposure.At the time, since the real estate market was booming, it presented many opportunities to reap large dividends on the investments made. This paved way for real estate development projects and also rewarded the investors financially. As far as the Indian market is concerned, REITs were first introduced here by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) in 2007. As the investment vehicle started gaining popularity, there were many regulations announced to facilitate smooth operations of these investment funds. Today, REIT companies that are listed on the Indian stock exchanges are constantly monitored and fall under the regulation of the Securities and Exchange Board of India or SEBI. How do REITs workThe flowchart below shows the basic process of a REIT transaction:UnitholdersInvestment in REIT————-> <————-DistributionsREITOwnership of assets ————> <————-Net property incomePropertiesBuy/sell property———-> <———-Sponsor Stock Investments Made Easy @ FisdomWhat are the Types of REITs?Mentioned below are some of the commonly available varieties of REITs in India:Equity REITs: These REITs primarily invest in offices, residential complexes, industrial estates, hotels etc. They buy, manage, set-up and sell real estate. The income earned is distributed to investors as dividends. Income is mostly generated through rentals and sale of properties. Mortgage REITs: These REITs loan out money to buyers of real estate, and some may even buy-out existing mortgages. They are also referred to as mREITs. These derive income from the interest received through mortgage loans. They work somewhat like a debt mutual fund, however, the risk component is often higher in REITs.Retail REITs: Retail REITs invest in the retail segment like shopping malls, grocery stores, hypermarkets, supermarkets, etc. However, retail REITs do not run these retail outlets. They only focus on renting out the space to various retail tenants. Returns in this case depend on the performance of the retail sector. Residential REITs: Residential REITs buy and operate apartment buildings, gated communities, and other such housing establishments. Whenever the residential property demand in India grows, these REITs reflect a positive growth.Healthcare REITs: Healthcare REITs invest in real estate for hospitals, medical establishments, health clinics, etc. Since the demand for healthcare services has been on a rise in the last few years, these REITs present a good investment opportunity for investors.Office REITs: These REITs focus on office properties and earn through rental income.Performance of REITs in IndiaAs per a report, listed Real Estate Investment Trust (REITs) in India saw a 6.85% year-on-year (YoY) growth in the total leasable area. From only 87.6 million square feet (msf) in Sep’21 to 93.6 msf in Sept’22.Mindspace REIT was one of the top performers with absolute returns of 8.11% in the YTD Oct’22 period. Brookfield India REIT came in second with 7.30% absolute returns. These two were followed by Embassy REIT with 1.40% absolute returns during the same period.(Source – moneycontrol)Taxation on REITsInvestors must consider the below points about taxation on REITs before investing in them:Income from sale of REIT unitsCapital gains from sale of Indian REIT units are subject to short-term capital gains tax at 15% if held for less than one year. Units held for more than three years (36 months) are subject to LTCG tax at 10% if they result in an income over Rs.1 lakh. Additional points on taxation:Interest income from REITs is taxable. Dividend income from REITs is taxable depending on the REIT’s special tax concession status. If special tax concession has been obtained, dividend income is taxable in the hands of the investor. If not, dividend income is not taxable. Income from amortisation of SPV debt is not taxable in the hands of the investor.Advantages & disadvantages of investing in REITsInvestors can avail below-mentioned advantages from REIT investments:Investment in real estate properties can be very capital intensive. However, shares of REITs are comparatively affordable, as investors can purchase few units at a time without worrying about large capital outflows. REITs are suitable for small Investors too, as these eliminate direct dealing with property builders. Also, REITs come with lower liquidity risk as compared to direct property investment.REITs are listed in stock exchanges. Hence all pertinent details can be checked online by investors before making an investment.REITs offer income to investors primarily through dividend. The dividend payment in most REITs is relatively assured. This is because the primary source of earning is through rental (lease) income. REITs are regulated by SEBI, and therefore the chances of fraud are low.Investors must take note of these drawbacks of Investing in REITs:Limited growth potential due to large distributions to investorsHigher taxes on dividends compared to other investmentsPotentially high fees and increased riskVulnerability to real estate market trends and fluctuationsLack of control over performance and management decisionsPotential restrictions on selling shares for a set period of time.How to Invest in REITs in India?Investing Through Stock ExchangesSimilar to ETFs, REITs are listed and traded on stock exchanges.
