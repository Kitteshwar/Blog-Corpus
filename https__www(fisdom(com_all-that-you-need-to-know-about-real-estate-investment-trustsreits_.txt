Historically in India, investors have been investing in real estate by purchasing a property or land via real estate developers and property brokers. In such investments, investors had to rely on long-term market value appreciation of the property to generate a return on investment. This, however, was only possible when real estate markets would be on an upswing. Developers also had to fund projects by sourcing money through loans from banks, PE firms, etc and this usually meant high-interest rates. In 2008, the Security and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) came up with draft guidelines that allowed investors to establish REITs as an asset class. The intent was to make it easier for foreign investors to invest in the Indian real estate market and make funding easily available for local developers. How did REITs evolve?REITs were first introduced in the USA back in the 1960s on similar lines as mutual funds. These were initiated to boost real estate development through existing investments from investors who were interested in real estate exposure.At the time, since the real estate market was booming, it presented many opportunities to reap large dividends on the investments made. This paved way for real estate development projects and also rewarded the investors financially. As far as the Indian market is concerned, REITs were first introduced here by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) in 2007. As the investment vehicle started gaining popularity, there were many regulations announced to facilitate smooth operations of these investment funds. Today, REIT companies that are listed on the Indian stock exchanges are constantly monitored and fall under the regulation of the Securities and Exchange Board of India or SEBI. How do REITs workThe flowchart below shows the basic process of a REIT transaction:UnitholdersInvestment in REIT————-> <————-DistributionsREITOwnership of assets ————> <————-Net property incomePropertiesBuy/sell property———-> <———-Sponsor Stock Investments Made Easy @ FisdomWhat are the Types of REITs?Mentioned below are some of the commonly available varieties of REITs in India:Equity REITs: These REITs primarily invest in offices, residential complexes, industrial estates, hotels etc. They buy, manage, set-up and sell real estate.
