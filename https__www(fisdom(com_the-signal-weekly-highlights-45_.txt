Reportedly, Parle Products has seen a 10 per cent growth in sales volumes of value packs of biscuits in the last 4-5 weeks, whereas, sales of small packs of premium range has grown by five per cent.India’s villages, which contribute 35% to overall FMCG sector sales, saw growth declining from September as steep inflation of food, daily essentials and fuel and declining wages forced consumers to buy cheaper products or stop buying altogether.Centre’s debt to GDP ratio for FY22 lower than budgetedThe central government reined its debt at 56.29 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) at the end of 2021-22, lower than the revised estimates (RE) of 59.9 per cent for the fiscal. The ratio turned out to be lower on two counts. Firstly, market borrowings were lower by an approximate Rs.780 billion. Secondly, the GDP grew at a faster clip than anticipated.RBI, in its latest Financial Stability Report, raised concerns over rising consolidated debt-to-GDP ratio of the government. It feared that higher debt requirement would keep supply of government papers elevated, thereby putting upward pressure on yields. This, in turn, may crowd out the private sector from the financial resources envelope.Auto companies to spend more than USD 3 bn in capex in 2022-2023Automobile companies are expected to invest more than USD 3 billion or Rs.270 billion on capital expenditure in the year 2022-23, posting a growth of 24 per cent.The amount will be more than pre-Covid capex peak of Rs.268 billion in 2019-20.
