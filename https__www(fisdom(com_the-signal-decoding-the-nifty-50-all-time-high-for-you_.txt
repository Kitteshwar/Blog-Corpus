Is it best to wait out the fall and then invest?While these questions are valid, we go a step further and ask, “What is All-Time High, and does it hold any significance?”Simply put, all-time highs are when markets beat their previously recorded highest levels.And their significance?Well, that answer varies depending on your investing style:For traders (short-term participants), markets making new highs is extremely attractive as it fits well in their approach of making a quick buckFor investors (long-term participants), markets making new highs is another good day at the office but holds less weight in their adopted approach.If anything, the shooting up of equity valuations can cause asset allocation mismatch.(Get your portfolio vetted today with Fisdom research)Building on this insight, let us see why the market making peaks more normal than the news and noise around it:So, are markets peaking a frequent instance?

And for when that happens, resort back to this note to keep emotions at bay and act in the interest of investing principles.And lastly, here’s a fun math fact for all those who think exciting at the marketall-time time high will tide over all their losses:If a stock falls by 75% from ₹100 to ₹25, it will need to gain 300% to recover to its original priceIf it falls by 90%, it needs to go up by 900% to recover to its original priceHence, think wise and act wiser.
