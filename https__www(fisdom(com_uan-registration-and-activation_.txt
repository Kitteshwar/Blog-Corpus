The authority i.e. Employee Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) allocates the UAN to the provident fund account holders. It is a unique number that is assigned to each employee by the company.  It is important to remember that each employee of the organisation can have only one UAN. A company that has more than 20 employees must generate UAN for its employees. The company is obligated to provide UAN cards to contract workers too, so long as they contribute toward the Provident Fund.
