It, combined with capital, land resources, extensive grid system, makes it an ideal candidate to make a quick transition to green hydrogen.Airports: India was the fifth largest aviation market based on airline passengers as of 2019. The country is poised to emerge as the third largest by 2025. It is already the third-largest domestic passenger market and is expected to be among the fastest-growing domestic air passenger markets over the next decade.Data Centers: India hosts approximately 164 data centres spread across nine cities. Total installed capacity as of Fiscal 2022 was 550–580 MW and 320-370 MW in Fiscal 2020. With the pandemic-induced challenges, digital transformation became necessary, and the demand for hybrid cloud and colocation models surged. Data usage also increased, creating more need for data storage and transforming the data centre industry to a large and strategically important segment.Roads: India has the second largest road network in the world, aggregating 6.4 million km. Roads are the most common mode of transportation and account for about 87% of passenger traffic and close to 63% of freight traffic.Water: In India, water use is broadly used for domestic (household purposes) and industrial usage. The water treatment industry comprises fresh and clean water and managing wastewater for commercial/residential customers and industries.Copper: Domestic copper demand logged a 1.9% CAGR between Fiscals 2017 and 2022. The share of secondary copper has been rising gradually since 2017 owing to better scrap availability and increasing primary copper prices. Renewable energy as a sub-segment in the overall power segment will significantly determine copper demand over the medium term. Copper is used to making solar modules and electric motors for wind and hydropower generation.Key Takeaways:Raising fresh money by issuing fresh equity would reduce the company’s high leverage and increase public shareholding. Except for the current valuation, the current state of business, growth prospects, and financial strength seems close to reasonable. High-risk investors with a long-term horizon seeking a play into infrastructure, industrials & utilities can use the FPO to invest in AEL.Read more on Adani FPO  FeaturedThe Signal  The Signal – Budget FY24: Expectations 28 Jan  6 minutes   FeaturedThe Signal  The Signal- Attrition Declines, Margins improve: Road Ahead For IT 14 Jan  6 minutes   The Signal  The Signal: Decoding India’s manufacturing push 07 Jan  4 minutes   The Signal  The Signal: MF Industry – Key Milestones and Trends 31 Dec  4 minutes   The Signal  The Signal: Steely resolve to outperform 17 Dec  5 minutes   The Signal  The Signal: Big Plays with Big Tech 10 Dec  7 minutes   The Signal  MPC Update December-22 07 Dec  2 minutes   The Signal  The Signal: Decoding the NIFTY 50 all-time high for you 03 Dec  5 minutes   The Signal  The Signal: IPO – Initial Public Opportunity? 26 Nov  5 minutes   The Signal  The Signal: Hotel stocks gain traction as restrictions ease 19 Nov  5 minutes   The Signal  The Signal: Q2 earnings season: Hits & Misses 05 Nov  4 minutes   The Signal  The Signal: Realty outpaces reality! 29 Oct  5 minutes
