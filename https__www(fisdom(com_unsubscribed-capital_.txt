It is the money invested by shareholders in a company. It acts as a long-term source of finance which is provided by shareholders in return for a share of ownership in the company. Here are the different types of share capital:Authorised capitalIssued share capitalSubscribed share capitalCalled up capitalPaid up capitalDetailed explanation of unsubscribed capitalThe term “unsubscribed” refers to newly issued securities that have not attracted many subscribers or investor interest. These securities are not offered by brokerages before the issue date. If an investor wants to own the newly issued stocks, they can only buy them via the secondary markets just like any other stock. In simple terms, shares that are not bought or subscribed in an Initial Public Offering (IPO) before its announcement are categorised as unsubscribed.Most IPOs are normally supported by an investment bank in determining the big quality which can help in reaching an optimum number of subscriptions. A very high offering price may cause the shares to remain unsubscribed and the portion of the unsubscribed IPO may further impact the overall share prices.Understanding unsubscribed securitiesAn issuing company may be unable to raise its projected capital if the IPO remains unsubscribed to a certain extent. A public offering subscription can be interpreted as an offer to purchase a firm’s stock once it has been published. If investors do not subscribe to a particular public issue via the public offering, it means they are not interested in buying those shares.If some of the IPO shares remain under-subscribed, the issuing company could recall the shares and decide to reimburse the buyers who may have expressed interest. Alternatively, some investment banks may keep a set of backup buyers or back stop purchasers ready and step in to purchase the unsubscribed shares.A back stop purchaser is somewhat like insurance, in that the purchaser guarantees to buy some portion of a company’s shares to help in raising the intended amount of capital.For example, suppose Bank ABC is unable to sell all its shares through the IPO (this is the unsubscribed portion), the back stop purchaser will agree to buy leftover shares. The back stop purchaser, in turn, commands a fee for such an agreement since it will be taking on the risk of purchasing (and thereby reissuing) the company’s securities.When a portion of an IPO remains unsubscribed, the issuing company will be unable to raise the amount of funds originally sought. Therefore, the issuer may need the help of an underwriter for buying the unsubscribed portion. Once a portion of an IPO remains unsubscribed, the shares may rise or fall as per the interest levels of the open market. These shares can be sold or bought among investors through the country’s stock exchanges.Why do companies need to issue shares to the public?Companies issue shares to the public for raising capital or for financing their business operations, business expansion, and also for meeting other financial needs.

This results in unsubscribed capital. FAQsHow does an IPO work in India?IPO or Initial Public Offering is an offer by a company to buy its shares in exchange for capital.
