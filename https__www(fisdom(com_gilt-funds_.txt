What are gilt funds and how do they work?Gilt funds are considered to be a type of debt mutual fund but unlike other mutual funds, they invest in Government securities. The underlying government securities are issued by the Reserve Bank of India on behalf of the Government of India and the rate of interest is also set by RBI. This makes them quite safe with virtually zero risks of default.The Reserve Bank of India is the source of funds for the State Government and the Central Government whenever they require such funds for various projects. When the Government approaches RBI for funds, the latter gathers them from various banks and insurance organizations to lend them to the State/Central Government.The RBI in turn issues Government Securities or G-Secs that are of a fixed tenure. These G-secs or Government securities are subscribed under the gilt funds. Gilt funds have multiple G-secs of different maturities. When security under the fund reaches maturity, it is returned by the fund to receive a payout.What are the benefits of gilt funds?Gilt funds provide many benefits to investors. Some of such benefits are highlighted below.Wealth protectionGilt funds invest in government securities. These securities have the benefit of government support and hence do not face the risk of default in interest payments or capital redemption. The investment of the investor is always secured and can be returned to them at the time of redemption from the fund.Risk free investmentGilt funds are risk free investments where there is no default on the payments due to the investors. These funds are, however, exposed to interest fluctuation risks. The change in interest rate is inversely proportional to the NAV of the gilt fund. Moderate returns The returns on gilt funds are higher than traditional investment options. The returns on gilt funds are influenced by the changing interest rates hence there are no guaranteed returns but in case of reducing interest, the returns provided by the gilt funds can be higher than even equity funds.Types of gilt fundsGilt funds are broadly classified under two categories based on the type of securities they invest in. The type of gilt funds are long term gilt funds and short term gilt funds.Long term gilt funds invest in securities ranging from 5 years to 30 years.
