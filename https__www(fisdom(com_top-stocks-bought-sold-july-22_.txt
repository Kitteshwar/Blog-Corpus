Despite the upswing, mutual fund managers have been cautious in picking stocks, especially for fresh purchases as the world economies continue to face inflationary pressures. With rising interest rates across the domestic and international markets, experts anticipate some market correction after this upswing. A mutual funds composition can tell a lot about the stock markets and the performance of specific stocks. Retail investors must follow this information to gauge market sentiment and also enhance their stock investment decisions. So, what did mutual funds invest in and what did they sell off in July 2022?

Fund managers are also bullish about certain auto ancillary, health insurance, vehicle finance, and Agri solutions companies.Fund houses also went down recently on investing in the IT sector. Similarly, fund houses are staying away from the oil & gas sector.ConclusionIn July, mutual fund inflows were seen slowing down whereas stock indices went up. Despite turbulent stock market conditions and macroeconomic instability, investors showed positivity with the SIP inflows into equity funds. While actively managed mutual funds saw a slowdown, it was the passive funds which were hot picks for most investors. For active fund investors, it is important to keep a close watch on where the funds are parking their money and where they are withdrawing from. FAQs1. Are passive funds managed by fund managers?While passive funds do have fund managers, they do not actively pick stocks for investment since passive funds generally follow the composition of the underlying index or benchmark.2. Should I invest in stocks that major mutual funds are investing in?Mutual fund compositions are decided by experienced fund managers. When some major mutual funds buy a certain stock, they are expecting the prices to rise and fetch good returns. Therefore, it makes sense to track the entry and exit of mutual funds from stocks and enhance investment decisions.3. Should I exit from stocks that major mutual funds are avoiding?When major mutual funds avoid investing or exiting a certain stock, it indicates that the stock prices may go down. Therefore, investors can conduct due diligence before investing in such stocks.4. Are equity mutual funds safer than stock markets for new investors?Since equity mutual funds are managed by fund managers who are experts in investment decisions, new investors can lower their risk by investing in mutual funds instead of directly investing in stocks.Share the article                      Get exclusive content
