By following certain guidelines one can determine the strength or weakness of a certain shift observed in the market. The general idea is to avoid participating in market shifts that reflect weakness. Instead, it is advisable to join stronger shifts. The following pointers can help investors reach their goals when using volume trading. It is important to note, however, that these do not apply to every situation and only act as a general set of guidelines.Indicator of a trendA rising volume often indicates the start of a rising market, in which it is recommended that buyers should continue to increase their stake and push the prices further up in the market. A scenario in which there is an increase in price but a decrease in volume suggests that there is a lack of interest. This is an indication of a possible reversal. Volume alone may not necessarily be a strong indicator. A price decrease in a large volume trade is considered a stronger indicator.Correlation of volume and priceA price against volume analysis can indicate bullish or bearish signs. For instance, if prices of a stock are falling despite high volumes, it indicates the start of a bearish sentiment. Similarly, if prices are rising with high volumes, it reflects bullish sentiments could be taking over. Although volume and prices are related, it may not mean that each of their movements is in sync with the other.Commonly usedMomentum is the rate at which stock prices change over time. It helps in identifying a trend. Rising prices are indicators of a bullish momentum, whereas falling prices reflect bearish momentum. To spot momentum, one can conduct a price to volume analysis.Another option is by using the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD). Traders mostly try to identify bullish or bearish indicators to plan their exit or entry. Types of volume indicatorsHere are the main volume indicators that often form part of technical analysis in stock trading:On balance volume (OBV)OBV is a basic volume indicator. It considers volume changes for predicting stock prices. The assumption under this method is that volume and price are interlinked. The direction in which the On Balance Volume line moves tells traders about the momentum. Thus, if the OBV line is trending upwards, one can expect a bullish phase.Chaikin money flowThis method was invented by a popular American trader. It is used to measure the dominance of buying or selling pressures in the market. As per CMF indicator, if a stock’s closing price nears its high, it means accumulation or buying pressure. When the closing price nears the stock’s low price, it reflects selling pressure.Klinger oscillatorConsidered being more complex than the OBV indicator, Klinger oscillator shows a comparison between volume and price. It converts the result of the comparison into an oscillator to predict price reversals. Investors can identify long-term money flow trends for select stocks using this indicator.How can volume in trading benefit investors?Here are some of the key benefits of using volume in trading for investment decisions:Volume helps investors in analysing share market trends and patterns. Whether an investor wants to look at the trend in the entire stock market or specific stocks, the volume information is easy to access and can be used for trend spotting.Volume is a measure of the total number of shares traded during a trading day, whether it is for buy or sell orders.
