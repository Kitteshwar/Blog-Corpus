As per these accounting standards, there are many types of reserves that a company needs to create in their books of accounts for different purposes. The usage of such reserves is restricted depending on the nature of the reserve. These reserves are a charge in the company’s profits or an addition to them. One such important reserve is the revaluation reserve and it is reflected in the balance sheet of the organization. Given below are the meaning of the revaluation reserve and a few details relating to this concept. What is a revaluation reserve?Let us first begin with the meaning of revaluation reserve in the books of accounts. The term revaluation literally means a reassessment of the value of something. A revaluation reserve is created when the company reevaluates the value of its assets or liabilities of the company and reports them at their true value in the books of accounts.There are two methods to create a revaluation reserve, namely, the indexation method and the current market price method. In case the value of the revalued asset is higher than the original book value, the difference will be credited to the revaluation reserve account. In case the value of the revalued asset is lower than the original book value, the difference will be debited to the revaluation reserve account. The revalued asset is both the cases will be reflected at the revised revalued value in the books of account. This is a non-cash reserve as it has a mere book entry effect on the assets of the organization. The revaluation reserve is also held in the balance sheet of the organization on the asset side of the liability side of the company depending on the positive or negative reserve. Since the revaluation reserve is a non-cash reserve, the company cannot charge any cash expenses or losses as it would amount to setting off actual losses against unrealized gains. Any loss from the sale of such asset is first adjusted against the revaluation reserve earlier created. After such charge, if there is any surplus left in the revaluation reserve account is to be transferred to the General Reserve account. This amount is then available for distribution to the owners. Also, as per the provisions of AS 10 and guidelines of IFRS in this regard, any accumulated losses or depreciation can also not be set off against the revaluation reserve. However, any additional depreciation on account of upward revaluation of the assets has to be adjusted against this reserve to utilize it. What is the formula for revaluation reserve?Revaluation reserve is the difference between the fair market value and the book value of an asset. Therefore, the formula for the same is mentioned below,Revaluation Reserve = Market value of the asset – book value of the asset. When the market value of the asset is higher than the book value a positive revaluation reserve is created. When the market value of the asset is less than its book value, it implies that the asset is overvalued. A negative revaluation reserve is therefore created with a charge to the value of the asset. How is revaluation reserve accounted for in books of accounts?The journal entries for the creation of the Revaluation Reserve are mentioned below.When the current market value is higher than the book value, the journal entry for creating the revaluation reserve is mentioned below ParticularsDebit Amount Credit AmountAsset account XXXTo Revaluation Reserve AccountXXXWhen the current market value is lower than the book value, the journal entry for creating the revaluation reserve is mentioned below ParticularsDebit Amount Credit AmountRevaluation Reserve AccountXXXTo Asset account XXXHow is revaluation reserve different from capital reserve?A capital reserve is another important reserve to be created in the books of account.
