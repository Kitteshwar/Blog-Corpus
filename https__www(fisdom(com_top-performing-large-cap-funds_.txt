To gain good returns, investors should consider a five to seven-year horizon while investing in large cap funds. Here are some of the important things to consider before investing in these funds:Large Cap funds are not risk-proof: Large Cap equity funds do have several risks that are mainly market-related. However, these risks are significantly moderate as compared to small-cap or mid-cap funds.Consider the expense ratio: Large Cap funds do have expenses related to fund management. This affects the expense ratio of the fund. Hence, while choosing a fund, look for a lower expense ratio which can help in fetching higher profits.Work better for a longer investment horizon: Large Cap equity funds can fetch good returns in the medium to long run. It makes sense to remain invested for least three to five years in large cap funds so as to get reasonable returns.Are subject to Capital Gains Tax: Large Cap funds are subject to the same tax treatment as any other equity asset.
