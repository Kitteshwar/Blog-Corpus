This provides the fund manager with higher flexibility to invest across various asset classes and rebalance the fund from time to time. This limits the risk exposure of the fund and hence can be an excellent form of investment for the conservative investors who wish to limit the exposure in the mutual fund market yet earn stable and periodic returns over an extended period of time.Ideally, every investor can have a dynamic asset allocation fund in their kitty. These funds provide the benefits of equity, debt, and other asset classes in a balanced form giving good growth over the long term at the same time reducing the risk of equity investments. What are the advantages of dynamic asset allocation funds?There are several advantages of investment in dynamic asset allocation funds which are mentioned below.DiversificationThe biggest advantage of dynamic asset allocation funds is the diversified assets available in the fund. Investors can have the benefits of each asset class making them ideal for every class of investors.Risk-adjusted returnsThe returns of this fund are risk-adjusted which means the risk in the funds is managed effectively by the fund managers to ensure that they are not overexposed to any particular asset class. The returns generated are stable in both bullish and bearish markets. Also, the diversification of the fund can result in potentially higher returns than plain vanilla debt funds. The expertise of the fund managersFund managers play a key role in the performance of the fund. It is the fund manager’s expertise that helps in navigating the various ups and downs of the market cycles to ensure that the returns of the fund are not severely impacted and the risk on the fund also does not go too high so the fund does not lose focus of the investment objectives. Rebalancing decisions are based on fund manager expertise backed by thorough market research and analysis. What are the limitations of dynamic asset allocation funds?Like any other investment, dynamic asset allocation funds also have their own set of limitations. These are discussed below.Cost or expense ratioThe expense ratio and the cost of rebalancing the fund drive the overall expense of investment on the higher side making the returns cost-ineffective in certain cases.  Fund manager relianceThe fund relies on the constant rebalancing of the exposure to the underlying assets to mitigate the risks. This requires the acute expertise of the fund manager and increases the fund’s reliance on their decision-making ability to ensure that the investor’s interest is protected.Taxation The taxation of the dynamic asset allocation funds is quite complex as it has investments in different asset classes. This makes taxation of the funds a difficult task for the fund managers. What are the important things to consider while investing in dynamic asset allocation funds?Investment in any asset has to be made after considering all the relevant factors involved to ensure that the investors are not in for a rude shock and the investment is in line with their expectations. Some of such factors to be considered are mentioned below.Returns expectationsThe returns of dynamic asset allocation funds are usually higher than regular debt funds as they are also backed by the equity portion of the fund. However, the investors have to be aware that the returns are not as high as that of equity funds or equity-oriented funds. Having correct returns expectations will ensure that the investors do not over assume the returns potential of the fund. Risk assessment The risk of dynamic asset allocation funds like any other fund cannot be ignored while making an investment decision. The risks are low to medium on account of the fund being more or less balanced between equity debt and other asset classes. Period of investmentThe ideal period of investment in dynamic asset allocation funds is a minimum of approximately 3 to 5 years. This is the minimum duration required by the fund to go through the market cycles to be able to generate good returns for the investors.  Cost of investment  The cost of investment is another important consideration while making an investment decision. If the cost or the expense ratio of the fund is too high that it effectively negates the returns earned then the investment is no longer attractive. Hence, it is important to consider the overall cost of investment before making the investment decision.   How are dynamic asset allocation funds taxed?The taxation of dynamic asset allocation funds is quite complex. It often discourages the investors from making an investment in the fund. The returns from the dynamic asset allocation fund can be in the form of dividends and capital gains. Dividends from the fund are added to the taxable income of the investor and taxed at the applicable slab rates. Capital gains on the other hand are calculated based on the period of holding and the dominant asset class whether equity or debt.When the fund has more the 65% of the asset allocation towards equity, the fund will be taxed as per equity funds and in other cases when the debt exposure is more, they will be taxed in line with the taxation on debt funds. The details of the same are mentioned below.Type of fundsShort term gainsTax rateLong term gainsTax rateEquity-oriented mutual fundsLess than 12 months15% (plus cess and surcharge)12 months and moreExempt up to Rs.1,00,000Above Rs.1,00,000 taxed at 10% (plus cess and surcharge)Debt-oriented mutual fundsLess than 36 monthsSlab rate of investor36 months and more20% (plus cess and surcharge)ConclusionDynamic asset allocation funds are a healthy mix of different asset classes. This fund is ideal for all categories of investors especially if they are conservative and want to earn potentially high returns at limited risk exposure. The heavy reliance on the fund manager’s expertise can be usually detrimental to the interest of the investors but in the case of these funds, it is backed by in-house algorithms and models that help in making sound decisions without any bias. FAQsWhat is the risk parameter of dynamic asset allocation funds?The risk of dynamic asset allocation funds is lower than pure equity funds but higher than regular debt funds.Is investment in dynamic asset allocation funds favorable in bearish markets? Dynamic asset allocation funds mitigate risks of the various asset classes by rebalancing them as per the current market trends.
