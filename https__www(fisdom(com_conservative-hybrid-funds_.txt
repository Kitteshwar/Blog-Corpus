They invest in a mix of debt and equity. These funds follow a conservative approach to investing, which implies that most funds are invested in debt funds (low risk), and a little of the remaining corpus is allocated to equities (high risk).As per SEBI (Securities Exchange Board of India), conservative hybrid funds are mandatorily required to keep their debt exposure between 75 percent to 90 percent, and equity allocation should be between 10 percent to 25 percent. When it comes to debt allocation, a conservative fund can invest in government securities (G- secs), treasury bills (T- bills), bonds or debentures. Watch this video on YouTubeHow do conservative hybrid mutual funds work?Conservative Hybrid Mutual Funds follow a conservative strategy of investing by allocating the majority of corpus to fixed income or debt securities and a small portion to the equities. Thus, the returns, as well as the risks from these funds, are limited. The fixed-income securities provide stability in returns and capital protection, whereas the equities provide additional gains from favourable market movements.When compared to Bank Fixed Deposits, hybrid funds, in general, give higher returns, as there is some equity element present in the asset mix of the hybrid funds. However, it must be noted that conservative hybrid funds are not risk-free funds. This means that investors can lose their money due to various risks that affect these funds. The equity portion of the fund has market risk attached to it, resulting in capital erosion for the investors. Similarly, the fund’s debt allocation may face capital erosion due to credit risk and interest rate risk.Taxation of conservative hybrid mutual fundsThe taxation of a Conservative Hybrid mutual fund is quite similar to that of a pure debt fund. The gains arising from these funds short-term in nature are taxable as per the investor’s respective income tax slab rates. Long-term gains, i.e. gains from funds held for at least three years, are taxable at the rate of 20 percent with indexation benefits.  Who should invest in conservative hybrid mutual funds?As the fund’s name suggests, conservative hybrid funds are suitable for the traditional investors, i.e. who want stable returns with less risk. Conventional hybrid mutual funds can be a better alternative than a bank FD or pure debt mutual funds. Many risk-averse investors invest predominantly in bank FDs or other debt instruments. If such investors are looking to invest in equities, then conservative hybrid mutual funds can be one of them’s best options. New age investors who are willing to take a little exposure in the equities can also invest in such funds. Further, those near their retirement age, having a low-risk appetite and looking for safe investment avenues, can invest in these conservative hybrid funds.Investment in conservative hybrid funds can be made through a SIP (Systematic Investment Plan) or a lump sum route.What are top conservative hybrid mutual funds to invest in?If you are a conservative investor and feel that these mutual funds are suited to you, here is a list of top conservative hybrid funds that may be considered for investment:Edelweiss Balanced Advantage FundAbout FundThe scheme primarily invests in different arbitrage opportunities, equity investments, and equity derivative strategies.
