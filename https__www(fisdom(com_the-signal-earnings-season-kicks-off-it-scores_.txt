IT companies which have reported their results are few exceptions.Hawkish commentary & aggressive rate hikes by the US Fed.The expectation of recession in the US & EuropeThe global growth forecast was trimmed down to 2.7 per cent in 2023 from 6 per cent in 2021. It will impact the demand for the sector.Amid all these challenges, big four IT companies have posted decent earnings & shown remarkable resilience.

Even the demand for cloud & digital transformation was robust in North America & Europe, which has helped IT companies deliver strong results.So far, only TCS, Infosys, Wipro & HCL Technologies have reported their results from the Nifty 50 bucket. It is evident from the above table that even though the total revenue from these four companies rose by 20 per cent since pre-pandemic, the net profits are still below 6 per cent.
