These offer considerable flexibility since they are diversified equity funds investing primarily in stocks of companies with varying market capitalizations. Here are some of the important details around multi cap funds to aid investors in their investment related decision-making process.What is a Multi Cap Mutual Fund?Multi cap funds are equity funds that primarily invest across different market capitalisations, various themes, and segments. These do not follow caps as far as portfolio exposure is concerned and are therefore categorised under high-risk funds. However, multi-cap funds are required to invest a minimum of 65% of total assets in equity and equity-related instruments.Features of Multicap Mutual FundsSome of the top features of multi-cap mutual funds are mentioned hereunder.DiversificationMulticap mutual funds have the inherent benefit of diversification where investors are offered the benefit of a diversified portfolio consisting of stocks across different sectors and market capitalizations. This is crucial in reducing the risk of investing in a single company or sector.Risk-return perceptionMulticap funds aim to strike a balance between the risk and return perception of an investor. These funds offer potentially higher returns than large-cap funds while maintaining a lower risk profile than mid-cap or small-cap funds.FlexibilityMulticap funds have the flexibility to invest in stocks across different market capitalizations. This allows fund managers to take advantage of market opportunities in both large and small companies and enter and exit the securities with ease.Professional managementMulticap mutual funds are managed by professional fund managers who have the experience and expertise in selecting stocks across different sectors and market capitalizations. This is instrumental in meeting the aim of delivering superior returns to investors.Expense ratioMulticap mutual funds usually have a moderate expense ratio as compared to investments in pure equity funds. This helps in reducing the cost of investment for investors which ultimately results in higher returns,Long-term investment horizonMulticap mutual funds are suitable for investors with a long-term investment horizon. The usual investment horizon for investors in multi cap funds is 5 to 7 years which allows them to use the fund to meet their financial goals in a similar time frame.Taxability of Multicap Mutual FundsAs per the SEBI classification of mutual funds, multi cap mutual funds are classified as equity mutual funds. Therefore, their taxation is in line with the taxation of equity mutual funds. The dividends received from the fund are taxed in the hands of the investors at their applicable slab rates.Short-term capital gains are taxed at the rate of 15% while long term capital gains are taxed at a flat rate of 10% without the benefit of indexation. Investors, however, get the benefit of the exemption on long-term capital gains of up to Rs. 1,00,000 beyond which they are taxable in the hands of the investors. How can multi cap fund investments benefit a portfolio?Most mutual fund categories have restrictions regarding the investment types as defined in the fund objective. For instance, a large-cap fund cannot invest in mid and small-cap stocks to benefit from higher chances of profitability. Similarly, a mid-cap fund must invest only in mid and small-cap stocks even if there is a downturn in the market. This is when multi-cap funds can act as a better choice for investors. Multi-cap funds can take advantage of various investment opportunities available in the market, thereby having better chances of enhanced returns. Investors can balance their portfolio’s risk-return element through low-risk investments in combination with multi-cap fund investments.Who should invest in Multi Cap Funds?Investors who are willing to take on higher risks and do not have sufficient time to independently research specific investments in the market can invest in multi-cap schemes. These are mainly helpful for long-term wealth creation. Multi-cap funds have higher chances of generating superior returns as compared to large-cap funds. However, these may offer lower returns as compared to mid and small-cap funds in the long run.With multi-cap fund investments, investors can gain exposure to companies of varying sizes and reasonably diversify their portfolio.What are the risks of investing in Multi Cap Funds?Multi-cap funds may also invest in mid-cap and small-cap stocks and are therefore considered riskier when compared to large-cap schemes. During a market upswing, fund managers of multi-cap funds may increase exposure to mid and small-sized companies to maximise benefit from earnings. Similarly, fund managers may also switch from mid-cap companies to large-cap companies during prolonged market downturns. Thus, multi-cap fund investments pose higher volatility and higher risk for an investor.Top Performing Multi Cap Funds to Invest in 2023Some of the top performing high risk mutual fund recommendations for 2023 are:Invesco India Multicap FundAbout the FundThe fund aims to achieve long-term capital appreciation through investments in equity and equity-related securities of large, mid and small companies.
