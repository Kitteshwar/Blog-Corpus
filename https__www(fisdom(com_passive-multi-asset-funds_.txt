Since investment across asset classes results in varying risk-rewards, it enables the investor to contain the overall risk and fetch steady returns across different market cycles.Well-distributed portfolioA well-distributed portfolio with investments from different asset classes has a better chance of generating higher returns than a portfolio concentrated on one or two asset categories. A passively managed multi-asset allocation mutual fund offers the chance to automatically rebalance the portfolio, thereby helping investors to fetch maximum benefits, especially during turbulent market conditions. Easy entry and exitMulti-asset fund investments do not charge investors for investing in the scheme, and most do not charge exit loads if certain redemption conditions are met. Depending on its investment strategy, a multi-asset allocation fund can fetch good returns even if it has not been through a complete market cycle. With a passive approach in fund management, investors need not have asset allocation experience or understanding to earn complete benefits from these funds.Tax efficiency When a passive multi-asset fund does asset allocation across different categories, it makes the earnings more tax-efficient. This is because income from different asset classes attracts different tax liabilities and investors can balance out the overall tax liability through wider exposure.Who should invest in passive multi-asset allocation funds?The below points can help investors gauge whether this fund category is suited to them:Multi-asset allocation mutual funds are best suited for investors with a low-risk appetite and steady returns expectations on their investments. With this investment, investors can eliminate the risk of concentration in one asset class.Those looking for a regular income source can consider this fund option as the income comes from overall asset performance and remains relatively unaffected, even if some of the asset classes may be underperforming.How does investing in this fund benefit investors?Many investors may either avoid or miss out on asset allocation across segments. Instead, most tend to stay invested in performing assets during rising market scenarios. By exploring Indian as well as global equities, other assets such as fixed income and gold,  passive multi-asset funds aims to fetch earnings consistently while reducing the downside of individual asset performance.Although it may sound complex to many new investors due to the ambitious approach it adopts. However, considering that these funds are managed by experienced fund managers who manage at least 60 other mutual fund schemes across different asset classes, it carries a good track record of asset allocation decisions and corresponding results.Factors to consider while investing in this fundAlthough the fund adopts a passive management approach, at a macro level, the fund will have multiple fund managers making decisions about the right asset mix to be used. This means the establishment of the portfolio’s structure will not be entirely passive. Hence, investors must be prepared for a minimal level of bias towards asset selection.Also multi asset fund of funds get taxed as debt mutual funds, so that should also be a factor that you should pay attention to. ConclusionDifferent asset classes perform differently across various market and overall economic phases. Very rarely would an equity and a debt mutual fund perform equally well within the same time span. Commodity funds such as gold may perform well during market downturns when other assets are on a low. Thus, it makes sense to explore passive multi-asset funds to make the most of varied asset classes within the same fund with relatively lower fund manager intervention.FAQsPassive or active investing, which is the right choice?Lower cost, reduced risk, higher transparency, are some of the aspects that place passive investments over active, especially in case of mutual funds.
