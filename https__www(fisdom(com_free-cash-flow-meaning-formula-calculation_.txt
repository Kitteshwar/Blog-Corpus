It is measured to be the resultant amount available to be distributed to its investors, both equity and debt holders, and is calculated after considering all the capital expenditures and operating expenses of the organisation. Such cash can be used by the company to invest in different growth opportunities, reduction of debt levels, pay dividends, or repurchase shares. FCF is an essential metric for investors and analysts to determine a company’s financial health and growth potential. A company that generates positive free cash flow can reinvest in its business and use it to meet its various needs.

This can significantly increase the risk of default for investors and lenders.What is the formula to calculate free cash flow?The formula to calculate free cash flow (FCF) is:FCF = Operating Cash Flow – Capital ExpendituresThe Operating Cash Flow (OCF) represents the cash generated by a company’s operations while the Capital Expenditures (Capex) are the investments made by the business in property, plant, and equipment.Additionally, other formulas that can be used to calculate free cash flow areCalculating FCF using sales revenuesFree cash flow = Sales revenue – Operating costs and taxes – Investments in operating capitalCalculating FCF using Net operating profitsFree cash flow = Net operating profit after taxes – Net investment in operating capitalWhat are the pros and cons of free cash flow?Free cash flow (FCF) is a useful financial metric that can help investors and analysts evaluate a company’s financial health and growth potential.

Diverse accounting policies can make it difficult to compare FCF between companies in the same industry.Varied FCF due to fluctuations in working capitalWorking capital requirements can vary from time to time and it can affect the calculation of free cash flows. This can make it difficult for analysts to interpret the FCFs over short time periods and can lead to inaccurate decisions.Conclusion FCF is an important measure of a business’s real earning potential and its ability to stay afloat.
