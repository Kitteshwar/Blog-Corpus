Premium amounts on term insurance policies are going higher by 10-20% from this April onwardsWhy are the premium prices going higher? What’s changed now? Term insurance policies are pure life insurance products where fixed premiums are paid over a period of time and there is guaranteed payment of the pre-fixed amount in case of death of the insured.Just like you get an insurance policy to provide financial security to your family members in case of any eventuality, insurance companies get a cover for themselves from reinsurance companies. With Covid is still in the picture and higher than expected death rates among the policyholders due to Covid, the reinsurers have upped their rates for reinsurance from April. The reinsurance companies generally spread out their risks across geographies but with the pandemic, this ability has been greatly reduced.The term insurance policies are linked to the life expectancy and the quality of life in a country.
