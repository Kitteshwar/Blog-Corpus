This time, in ironical fashion, as India celebrates its freedom from colonialism, it is simultaneously at battle, weaving the path of freedom (read as: unlocking economy) from the viral virus. Today, as was yesterday, and as will be tomorrow; the commonality between rich and poor, between differing risk-return profiles, and across castes, creed, and religions, is/was/ & will be “LOANS”! The only bond stronger than loans, is all of humanity’s desire to rid themselves of these loans at the earliest possible times. The potency of loans has never been so bold as was in the last few months when the country went into lockdown. Amongst all panic that set-in, one that was on top of everyone’s list was their ability to pay loans, and the dent it was going to make in their savings. In a country where daily wages were key to survival, putting a halt to all activity was certainly detrimental to not only living but also surviving!The constant dependency on a stream of regular income with no room for interruption, is top contender for financial sin. The lockdown revealed the true imagery of the citizens – A blank canvas with the phrase, ‘DROWNING IN DEBT” painted in Red, signifying their bleeding pockets, and their degree of dependency on their income and their ability to pay loans. In fact, the loan situation was so gruesome, that, of the many policies announced via relief packages, one that disguised as an umbrella, courtesy of it having implications, on retail investors and domestic institutions alike was the “Loan Moratorium”.  It is evidently clear, that currently, we are a country where daily wages is not only key to living but also survival. This startling thesis is the key principle driving this piece.
