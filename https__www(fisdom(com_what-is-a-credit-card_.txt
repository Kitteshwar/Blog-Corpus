The credit card dues have to be repaid by the due date failing which there are many consequences like increased interest payment and negative impact on credit score among others. The credit limit of a person is decided based on their credit score and other factors like income level, age of the applicant, etc. When the cardholders carry out any financial transaction using the credit card, the amount is deducted from their credit limit.

Many times cardholders only pay the minimum amount due to restore their credit limit. Such consistent behavior will increase the interest cost on the credit cards making it eventually difficult for the cardholder to meet their commitments. Default in paying credit card dues is also reported to credit rating agencies which negatively impacts the credit report and the credit score effectively closing the doors to a new line of credit. Hence it is essential to be cautious of the debt trap of credit card. c. Risk of fraudThe risk of fraud through credit cards although low is always present. It is important to not disclose the CVV and the PIN to any other person to ensure the safety of the card. d.

Possible negative impact on credit scoreCredit cards have a direct impact on the credit score of the person. Any adverse use of the credit cards or default in payment of dues will negatively impact the credit score and harm the credit profile of the cardholder. ConclusionCredit cards are an essential part of today’s world no matter the limitations and the cost.
