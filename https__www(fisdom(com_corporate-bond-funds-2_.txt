Corporate bond funds aim to utilise credit opportunities offered by the corporate debt papers for earning returns. Here, we will talk about corporate bond funds and also share some of the top performing corporate bond funds for investors to consider making an investment.What are corporate bond funds?Organisations that need capital can raise funds through debt and equity instruments. Debt is usually a safer choice, as it doesn’t directly affect the shareholders of the company and the promoter stake in the company is not diluted. Bonds or debentures can also be economical alternatives for raising funds. Therefore, most companies go for debt issues to raise capital. But like any other loan, interest has to be paid and the principal has to be repaid at the end of the tenure of the debt raised. Debt mutual funds try to make the most of credit opportunities offered by corporate bond securities. A corporate bond fund invests over 80% of the total funds in corporate bonds. Corporate bond funds are gaining popularity among the debt instrument market as investors gain from a combination of corporate exposure and security offered by debt investments.Watch this video on YouTubeTypes of corporate bond fundsIn India, there are various types of corporate bond funds available for investors. These funds invest in corporate bonds issued by companies and offer different features and objectives. Here are some common types of corporate bond funds:Short-term corporate bond funds: Invest in bonds with a shorter maturity period, typically less than three years.Medium-term corporate bond funds: Focus on bonds with a medium duration, generally between three to seven years.Long-term corporate bond funds: Concentrate on bonds with longer durations, typically more than seven years.High-yield bond funds: Invest in corporate bonds with higher credit risk but potentially higher yields.Dynamic corporate bond funds: Adjust the portfolio’s duration and credit exposure based on market conditions.Who should invest in corporate bonds?Corporate bond mutual funds have comparatively lower risk sensitivity since these invest in debt instruments by aiming for capital protection. Risk-averse investors who want reasonable returns and sufficient liquidity on their investments can go for corporate bond funds. As compared to other debt instruments, corporate bonds offer higher interest rates since they involve higher credit risk. The risk level also depends on investment patterns adopted by a mutual fund’s portfolio manager. Companies that have high credit ratings may have lower chances of defaulting, thereby reducing the risk element of the portfolio.What are the benefits of investing in corporate bond funds?Some of the major benefits of investing in corporate bond funds are –1. Better returnsCorporate bond funds can generate better returns as compared to other debt instruments. The returns of these funds often range around 8-10% whereas government-issued bonds can provide only half of these returns. But remember, government issued bonds are safer as they have the guarantee of the Govt. 2. Higher liquidityCorporate debt funds mainly cater to short-term financing needs of a business. Therefore, these are often short term in nature. These can also be freely bought and sold as per personal investment goals. Therefore, investors can benefit through higher liquidity, as they can convert the mutual fund unit in dynamic bond funds into cash when a need arises.3. Lower riskCorporate debt funds are less risky as compared to stocks since debt is a financial obligation (liability) on the company. Equity is subject to the profits and losses of a company and is therefore relatively riskier.4. Different varietiesCorporate bond funds are often differentiated on the basis of fund tenure and credit ratings of the companies that form part of the portfolio. This differentiation allows investors with different investing patterns to invest in corporate bond funds. For instance, those who want to invest for the short-term combined with low-risk investment options can invest in corporate bonds that have a shorter maturity period.Higher returns are also possible through investments in low rated companies. For this, the fund has to be managed by an expert portfolio manager who makes strategic investment decisions. Organisations that have a lower credit rating may offer higher coupon value to attract investments from individual investors and mutual funds. Portfolio managers may invest a sizable portion of the total pool in such funds during market conditions while liquidating the funds in case of market turbulence. Taxation on Corporate Bond FundsIf an investor remains invested in a corporate bond fund for less than three years, short-term capital gains tax (STCG) is applicable as per the individual’s tax slab. Section 112 of the Indian Income Tax states that 20% tax is applicable with indexation benefit on long-term capital gains from these fund investments if the units are retained for at least 3 years.Important points to note before investing in corporate bond fundsHere are some aspects that investors must consider before investing in corporate bond funds:Corporate bond funds must ideally be considered for long-term investment since these invest in corporate debentures and bonds that have medium to long-term tenures.It is important for investors to have some amount of market knowledge while investing in corporate bond funds. This will help in understanding the potential risks and market sentiments.In case of a large number of defaults, there could be a severe impact on the portfolio returns. It makes sense to prefer investing through large AMCs. New investors must try to invest in high-rated short-term debt funds that have lower credit risk.Best Corporate bond funds to invest in Here’s a look at some of the top corporate bond funds:1.
