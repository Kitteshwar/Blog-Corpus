The VIX is calculated using Nifty options and reflects expected volatility in the next 30 days.

The VIX has proven to be a valuable tool for gauging risk and volatility in the market.What is India VIX?India VIX depicts the expected market volatility or market risk. Here is how it can best be used for an easier understanding and interpretation of market volatility:Equity traders can use the India VIX as a risk measure, especially for intraday trading and short-term trading. By looking at this index, a trader can get a fair idea of market movements and accordingly strategise their trading or investment. For instance, if higher volatility is expected, intraday traders may be exposed to a higher risk of frequent stop-loss activation. This means they must minimize leverage or proportionately expand their stop losses.For long-term investors, short-term market volatility does not matter a lot. However, institutional investors may have to limit their overall risk and MTM losses. In case higher market volatility is expected, as per India VIX, such large-scale investors can expand their hedges by using ‘put options’.Traders who trade in options can also benefit from the India VIX. Buy or sell decisions in options trading are based on market volatility. In case it is likely to rise, options may rise in value and buyers can gain further. If VIX is seen to be coming down, option sellers are likely to gain.India VIX can also help investors in gauging index movement. As per historical statistics, India VIX has had a negative correlation with the Nifty movement in the last decade. Markets are generally at their peak when the VIX is at its lowest and vice versa. This can especially offer good inputs to index trades.VIX is also used by portfolio managers to increase the proportion of high Beta securities in the portfolio when the VIX is at its highest. Similarly, fund managers can use VIX lows to add low beta stocks to the portfolio.ConclusionIndia VIX is only about a decade old but has proved to be a very useful tool to gauge market risk and market volatility. When India’s VIX rises, investors consider it a good time to buy stocks.
