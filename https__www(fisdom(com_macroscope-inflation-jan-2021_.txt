Core CPI remained unchanged at 5.34% after rising to its highest in ~2 years at 5.51% in Nov’2020.Inflation has seen significant downfall over the last few months, considering it registered its highest ever levels in October 2020, and was above RBI tolerance level for 8 consecutive months up to November 2020. With inflation reducing & IIP expanding, economy is finally emerging from the long shadow of coronavirus pandemic.Element InflationsInvestor TakeawayThe fall in inflation can be credited to continuous fall witnessed in vegetable prices which slipped 15.8% YoY and 10.4% in last 2 months respectively.High base-effect came into play too in seeing inflation picture a softer print. The base play can misguide real inflation figures in H1CY2021, courtesy of extraordinary inflation seen in comparison figures.The continued downtrend in veggie prices were countered with broad-base increase in other food items. The after-effect of unlockings has translated into higher oil prices as prices follow an upward trajectory, thus posing as risk to inflation metric in coming times.The rate of price rise in the food basket was 1.89% in January, significantly down from 3.41% in December.As pressures on perishable food prices ready for a go on the downside, other factors such as increased input and output costs, higher labor charges and rising oil prices can dampen hopes of drop in inflation in coming times.Core-inflation is expected to chart a similar trajectory as demand-side factors continue to battle the covid brunt.In last bi-monthly monetary policy meeting, the central bank kept its key interest rates unchanged while maintaining its accommodative stance. Continuing to focus on growth via polices and packages, RBI is to use an arsenal of unique liquidity and similar supportive strategies to maintain current pace of expedited growth.Broad-based domestic and global economic recovery should improve aggregate demand, posing an upside risk to inflation. Favorable base effect, appreciating rupee and any risk of new covid-strain led slowdown, will be a tailwind for CPI inflation.It is likely for RBI to remain on pause in April meet and consider rate-cuts in near future after efficacy in transmission of prior rate-cuts.Click here If you want to read the complete CPI Inflation press release  Macroscope  Macroscope – Government Finances: Way Ahead 04 Jun  1 minute   Macroscope  Macroscope – Eight Core Industries Update 03 Jun  0 minutes   Macroscope  Macroscope – Indian Industrial Production (IIP) | Index For The Month May 2021 14 Jul  2 minutes   Macroscope  Macroscope – Inflation | CPI Inflation For The Month June 2021 13 Jul  3 minutes   Macroscope  Macroscope – Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) – Services PMI for the month June 2021 05 Jul  3 minutes   Macroscope  Macroscope – Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) – June 2021 02 Jul  3 minutes   Macroscope  Macroscope – CPI Inflation For The Month May 2021 15 Jun  3 minutes   Macroscope  Macroscope – WPI Inflation For The Month May 2021 15 Jun  3 minutes   Macroscope  Macroscope – Indian Industrial Production – Reading Of IIP Index For The Month April 2021 14 Jun  2 minutes   Macroscope  Macroscope – Purchasing Managers’ Index – Services PMI for the month May 2021 10 Jun  3 minutes   Macroscope  Macroscope – RBI Monetary Policy Meet – Policy Update for the month June 2021 04 Jun  3 minutes   Macroscope  Macroscope – Purchasing Managers’ Index – Manufacturing PMI for the month May 2021 01 Jun  3 minutes
