It securely holds various securities in a digital format, thereby assisting stock exchanges are stock market participants.CDSL TPIN is a crucial component of the stock trading process. It comes in the form of a six-digit passcode that must be entered for authorizing the broker to sell selected stocks from an investor’s Demat account.The CDSL TPIN security mechanism enables investors to easily authorise any account-related action online. It acts as an additional layer of security while operating Demat accounts online. It provides a unique One Time Sell Authorisation passcode or pin delivered to the user’s mobile number through CDSL. This is required for validating Demat account transactions. Why is CDSL TPIN required?We all know that stock market trading mandatorily requires an investor or trader to have trading and Demat accounts. Once an investor has opened a Demat account with a registered broking house, he/she is authorized to trade in stocks or place buy/sell orders through exchanges like BSE and NSE. These accounts are essentially registered with the CDSL, depending on the broker chosen. Whenever an individual places a buy order on a stock, the broker will receive those shares in digital form on behalf of the buyer. The broker then transfers them to the buyer’s Demat account. Since there was no security aspect involved in such transactions earlier, broking houses introduced something called a POA or Power of Attorney. This is a document that authorises the broker or broking house to sell stocks on behalf of the client or Demat account owner.However, POA does not allow digital signatures as per the IT act mandate. This means an investor or trader will have to physically sign a POA to authorise the broker to carry out the transaction on his/her behalf. The signed copy of the POA then has to be delivered to the broking house before the sale transaction can be initiated. To eliminate this hassle and improvise user experience, the POA method was taken off and, in its place, the TPIN was introduced. The TPIN method allows far better control to investors over their Demat accounts and makes the entire process far more reliable.When do you require authorization with TPIN?CDSL TPIN aids security and authorises users to take charge of their Demat account transactions. It is required for initiating a sell transaction on any Demat account.

Once clicked, the user is redirected to the CDSL webpage. The user must then enter the relevant CDSL TPIN to proceed.
