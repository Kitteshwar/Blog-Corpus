In India, silver ETFs are listed on the National Stock Exchange and the Bombay Stock Exchange. Here’s how they work:Investors buy and sell shares of the silver ETF on the stock exchange.The ETF owns physical silver that is stored in a vault, and the value of the shares is tied to the price of silver.As the price of silver fluctuates, the value of the ETF’s shares will also fluctuate.Investors can buy and sell shares of the ETF throughout the trading day, making it a convenient and liquid way to invest in silver.Top reasons to invest in Silver ETFsSilver ETFs are all set to be the future of investment for investors who would like to gain exposure to silver. Here are the top reasons to explore Silver ETF investment options:Advantage over investing in physical silverBy investing in a Silver ETF, one does not have to consider storage of bulky silver commodities, its quality, purity, or worry about liquidating the investment. Industrial demand for silverWorld over, silver demand is slated to rise since there is increasing dependency on this precious metal, especially in futuristic technologies like electric vehicles, 5G telecom, and green energy. With a higher demand expected for this metal, experts suggest that investors must consider silver as a good investment opportunity, especially from a long-term perspective.Hedge against inflationAcross the globe, silver enjoys high popularity within the precious metal options. This is primarily since silver is believed to be a good hedge against inflation and is not easily impacted by price movements in other asset classes.Portfolio diversificationInvestment in Silver ETFs can act as a good portfolio diversification opportunity with better returns as compared to precious metals like gold, especially noticed during economic revivals. Adding precious metals like silver to one’s portfolio can benefit investors, as silver prices are usually not interlinked with other prices of other securities like stocks and bonds. This reduces the overall portfolio risk.Professional fund managementInvestors can gain exposure to silver through silver ETFs without worrying about portfolio management, as these funds are professionally managed, making them easily accessible and transparent for investors. Lower expense ratioSince ETFs adopt a passive investment strategy, the fund manager does not actively select investments for the portfolio composition. This results in lower expenses incurred towards management cost and therefore a lower fund expense ratio charged to investors. Factors to note before investing in Silver ETFsAmong some of the disadvantages of Silver ETFs, since these are still new to the Indian financial markets, there are higher chances of lower liquidity. This can especially be because of the initial demand and supply conditions. Investors must also note that there are certain costs involved in purchasing an ETF.Also, as silver finds uses in industrial sector, it is a cyclical metal, which means that the demand for this product moves with the economic cycle. So, in cases of economic downturn, the prices of this metal may move down pretty quickly as industrial demand drops. Apart from expense ratio, some of the costs include brokerage fees and tracking error. These can contribute to lowering the return on investment for an investor. Silver ETF launches in India1.
