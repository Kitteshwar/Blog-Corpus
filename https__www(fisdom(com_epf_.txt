The employee’s contribution accounts for 12% of his or her salary and so does the employer’s contribution. But the contribution that the employer makes would be divided into 3.67% that would go towards EPF, 8.33% towards Employee Pension Scheme (EPS), 0.50% towards Employees Deposit Link Insurance Scheme (EDLIS), 1.10% towards EPF administrative charges, and 0.01% towards to EDLIS administrative charges. The beneficiary will get the entire principal with interest at the time of retirement.The rationale behind this service is to encourage the employees to save a part of their monthly salary toward their retirement corpus. It also helps the individual to enjoy the benefits of a tax free instrument (it is an EEE instrument) and is eligible for deductions under Section 80C.Eligibility for EPFEPF accounts can be held by both public and private employees. It is mandatory for employees that earn less than Rs. 15,000 and for those who earn more than Rs. 15,000, the employees have to take permission from the Assistant PF Commissioner and their employer to open an EPF account. This is because they are categorised as ineligible for the EPF. What are the benefits associated with EPF?Having an EPF account can be quite beneficial. This is because it can help with:Creating a corpus for your retirement. Remember that 8.33% of the contribution that employees make towards the EPF goes straight into the pension fund. Over time, this sum can be quite substantial.Generating capital by virtue of the interest garnered over time. Enjoying tax exemptions (up to 1.5 Lakhs)Creating an emergency fund to combat any unfortunate incident. Also, one can get higher capital gains, access life insurance aids and provide higher credit returns.EPF Services The services associated with this EPF account are all accessible online ranging from transfer to withdrawal to even checking one’s account statement.

It is important to note that the interest is calculated on a monthly basis based on the running balance of the employee and the same is credited into the employee account at the end of the financial year.The quantum of EPF will be calculated based on the sum total of one’s basic income, dearness allowance, and retaining allowance.How to apply for EPF?The enrollment of an individual into the EPF scheme happens at the discretion of the employer. The process in fact, is completed by the employer itself. The organisation can only enroll the employee if it is a registered company under Schedule I of the EPF Act and has a strength of 20 people in total.In case the individual is a business owner, then all eligibility criteria have to be met before enrolling in the scheme.Note that apart from your proof of identity (Aadhaar card/ passport), PAN details, and proof of residence (house papers, electricity bills, etc), there are a few other EPF-related forms that you need to be aware of.
