Therefore, over long periods of 10 to 20 years, equity assets, which deliver efficient inflation cover and growth, cannot be harnessed in NPS like in the ELSS scheme.Which option is more suitable for Tax Saving?If we were to solely look into the tax treatment of both these investment options, then the following would present itself before us – FeatureNPSELSSTax deduction on the amount invested For NPS sums up to Rs. 1,50,000 is exempt under section 80C and a further Rs. 50,000 is exempt under Section 80CCD(1B).For ELSS sums up to Rs. 1,50,000 are exempt under Section 80C.Tax on maturity amountThe maturity amount is partially taxable on 60% withdrawal amount. It is fully taxable on the annuity pension income.The maturity amount is taxable under capital gains tax.
