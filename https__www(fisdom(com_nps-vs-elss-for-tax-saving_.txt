But this also means that the returns are sizeably lesser. What is ELSS?Equity Linked Savings Scheme known as diversified equity funds and these offer the investor tax benefits that are applicable under the income Tax Act.ELSS have at least 80% of the total assets invested in equity and equity related instruments for a 3-year lock-in period.The power of compounding is what makes these ELSS funds a lucrative option for investors and the high returns helps beat inflation over the long run. However, the performance of the ELSS is based on the risk exposure to the market.What are the similarities between ELSS and NPS?Like any other investments there are a lot of similarities between ELSS and NPS, let’s take a look at them.Both instil financial discipline in the investors.Both the investment options pool in money from the investors and channelize the same into different asset classes.Contributions made into the corpus are voluntary.There is limited flexibility in the withdrawal of the funds.Both the investment options are professionally managed.Both of these funds are eligible for tax deductions under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act.What are the differences between the NPS & ELSS?BasisELSSNPSMeaning ELSS funds are diversified equity funds with a three year lock-in period.It is a government retirement scheme meant to develop a sizable corpus for retirement.Equity exposureThe equity exposure can go up to 100%.The equity exposure is merely 50 to 75%.Risk The risk depends on market fluctuations. Lower risk as the equity exposure is capped at a level.

There is no maximum. Minimum is Rs. 1000. There is no maximum.Tax benefitThe contribution is exempt from tax up to Rs 1.5 lakh. On redemption, Capital Gains tax may be payableThe entire amount is tax-free i.e. EEE. But the annuity that you get from NPS is subject to tax.Which option offers more benefits?Despite the tax benefits that NPS has to offer, equity mutual funds especially, the tax-saving ELSS awards the investor a lot more flexibility in terms of choosing options, schemes and investment time horizon – something that can help one build the retirement corpus that suits their requirements the best.NPS does not give the option to invest in long term equity assets like ELSS does as there is a mandatory requirement for fixed income exposure. Therefore, over long periods of 10 to 20 years, equity assets, which deliver efficient inflation cover and growth, cannot be harnessed in NPS like in the ELSS scheme.Which option is more suitable for Tax Saving?If we were to solely look into the tax treatment of both these investment options, then the following would present itself before us – FeatureNPSELSSTax deduction on the amount invested For NPS sums up to Rs. 1,50,000 is exempt under section 80C and a further Rs. 50,000 is exempt under Section 80CCD(1B).For ELSS sums up to Rs. 1,50,000 are exempt under Section 80C.Tax on maturity amountThe maturity amount is partially taxable on 60% withdrawal amount. It is fully taxable on the annuity pension income.The maturity amount is taxable under capital gains tax. The long-term capital gains are zero up to Rs. 1,00,000. Long Term Capital Gains tax to be taxed at 10% without indexation benefits for amounts exceeding Rs. 1,00,000.Both the investment options are great choices if the main goal is to save on taxes. NPS has a slight edge over ELSS funds in this area particularly as it falls under the EEE category and no capital gains tax has to be paid by the investor on the NPS amount.Experts believe that if a proper decision regarding this dilemma is to be arrived at then one has to deliberate and weigh the following considerations – probable age of retirement, the amount of corpus that needs to be accumulated, the investment horizon and the risk profile of the investor.FAQsIs an NRI eligible to join NPS?Yes, an NRI is eligible, subject to him or her retaining his or her indian citizenship status.
