When we value an investment in shares we directly value it according to its current market price. However, not many know that the same current market price will not be reflected in the books of accounts. This basic difference in the valuation of shares has to be understood to correctly value the investment portfolio and know the exact returns on investment. Given below is the basic meaning of the two most common modes of valuation of shares and the key differences between the two. What is the book value of shares?Book value of shares is a very common accounting term that is used to denote the value of the shares that are reflected in the balance sheet of the company. The book value of shares is also known as the net asset value or the carrying cost of the shares. The basic meaning of book value of shares is the value that will be received by the shareholders in case the company has to be liquidated. As per the Indian Accounting Standards, the book value of shares is to be recorded at the historical cost of the shares. This cost is determined after deducting the total liabilities and intangible assets of the company from the total assets of the company. The resultant amount has to be divided by the total number of outstanding common shares to derive the book value per share. This amount is expected to be received by the shareholders upon winding up of the company. What is the market value of shares?The market value of the shares is the current market price of the shares or the value at which the shares are traded in the market. It represents the market capitalization of the shares which is the value derived by multiplying the current price of the shares with the total number of outstanding shares in the market. The market price of the shares is very fluid and is determined on the basis of the demand-supply function of the market. The other factors influencing the market value of the shares are the financials of the company, profitability, internal and external news affecting the company and the sector as a whole, etc. Calculating book value & formula for book valueBook value is a measure of a company’s total value that is calculated by subtracting its liabilities from its assets. It represents the amount that shareholders would receive if a company were to liquidate its assets and pay off all its debts. To calculate the book value of a company, you need to add up all its assets, including cash, property, and equipment, and then subtract all its liabilities, such as debts and accounts payable.The formula for calculating book value is as follows:Book Value = Total Assets – Total LiabilitiesBook value is an important metric used by investors to evaluate the worth of a company’s assets. It provides a baseline valuation for a company’s shares and can be used to determine whether a stock is overvalued or undervalued. Investors can use the book value to calculate the price-to-book ratio, which compares the market value of a company’s shares to its book value. A price-to-book ratio of less than 1 indicates that a company’s shares may be undervalued, while a ratio of more than 1 may suggest that its shares are overvalued.What are the advantages of book value and market value of shares?The valuation of shares is done based on many parameters like the book value of shares, the market value of shares, the intrinsic value of shares, etc. The key advantages of determining the valuation of shares based on the two most common parameters namely, the book value of shares and market value of shares is mentioned below.Book value of sharesThe key advantages of knowing the book value of shares areThe book value of shares is the value mentioned in the balance sheet of the companyThis value is the first point of reference for the shareholders and the investors regarding the value of shares and their investment in the companyThe book value of shares is not highly fluctuating as compared to the market value of shares.Market value of sharesThe key advantages of knowing the market value of shares areMarket value is a determination of the current market price of the shares.A comparison of the market value of shares and the intrinsic value of shares helps in determining if the shares are undervalued or overvalued. What are the key differences between book value and market value of shares?After understanding the basic meaning of the book value of shares and the market value of shares, let us now discuss the basic differences between the two. CategoryBook value of sharesMarket value of sharesMeaningThe book value of shares is the value that is accounted for in the financial statements of the company and reviewed by the shareholders and the investors.The market value of shares is the value of market capitalization of shares. Presence in books of accountsThe book value of shares is reflected in the balance sheet of the companyMarket value is not reflected in any financial statementsStability of valuationBook value of shares does not fluctuate too often unless there is a major change in the value oo the total assets or total liabilities of the companyMarket value of shares is constantly fluctuating based on the changes in the current price of the shares Basis of the valuationBook value of shares is calculated by reducing the value of total liabilities and total intangible assets from the total assets of the company. Market value of shares is calculated by multiplying the current price of the shares and the total outstanding number of shares in the market. Target usersBook value of shares is reviewed and analyzed by shareholders and potential investors of the companyMarket value of shares is reviewed and analyzed by retail investors and traders in the market. Investment approachBook value of shares is used to calculate with a long-term approach or the long-term investment horizon in a company.Market value of shares is usually calculated with a short-term investment horizon in a company. ConclusionBook value of shares and market value of shares are two independent concepts that are used to determine the valuation of shares.

While the market value of shares changes rapidly based on market fluctuations, the book value of shares is more of a long-term approach to analyzing a company and its relative standing in the sector or the industry as a whole. FAQsIs the book value of shares readily available?No. The book value of shares is not readily available and has to be calculated using the balance sheet figures of the total assets, liabilities, and intangible assets of the company. What is the basic difference between the book value of shares and the market value of shares?The basic difference between the book value of shares and the market value of shares is that the book value will help in determining the amount received by shareholders upon liquidation of the company and the market value of the shares is the price at which the shares are bought and sold on the stock exchange.Share the article                      Get exclusive content
