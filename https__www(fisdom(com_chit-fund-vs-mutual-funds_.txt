By bringing borrowers and lenders together, chit funds helped individuals get a lump sum amount when they needed urgent funds for marriage, medical emergency, or business requirements. Chit funds go by many names like chitty or kuree, etc. In Chit funds, an individual enters into an agreement with a group of people such that all the parties can subscribe to a certain portion of the fund and receive it as periodical installments. There is a draw, or auction held periodically. Once an investor’s name is called out, he/she can draw the amount required and continue to pay periodical installments as per agreed timelines. The remaining amount in the fund is distributed among all the other members of the fund. A chit fund can be formed only after receiving prior approval from the state government. Chit funds are mostly limited to India. Some of the popular and successful chit fund houses in the country are:Mysore Sales International — Government of KarnatakaShriram Chits — Shriram GroupMargadarsi Chits — Ramoji Rao GroupKerala State Financial Enterprise (KSFE) — Government of KeralaHow do chit funds work?Let’s understand the mechanism of chit funds with the help of an example:A group of 20 people pools Rs. 1,000 each on a monthly basis. Thus, in the first month, the total accumulated amount will be Rs. 1,000*20 = Rs. 20,000.The accumulated amount will be put up for bidding and will be given to the person who offers the lowest bid. If Mr. A has quoted Rs. 10,000, Mr. B quotes Rs. 15,000 and Mr. C quotes Rs. 18,000, the lowest bid will be offered to Mr. A. The chit fund organiser will charge a commission at 5-10% depending on the fund. This means he/she will charge at least Rs. 500 as commission on this transaction (Rs. 10,000*5%).The balance in the fund, i.e., Rs. 20,000 – Rs. 10,000 = Rs. 10,000, will be equally divided among the 20 members of the fund. Thus, each individual will receive Rs. 500 per month. This process will continue until the end of the pre-decided fund tenure.What are mutual funds and how do they work?Mutual funds are investment vehicles in which investors can invest their money to get mutual fund units at the prevailing market value or NAV. These funds pool investor money to invest in various securities, as per the investment goals of the scheme. Investors can invest in mutual funds through systematic investment plan (SIP) or lump sum investments. The Asset Management Company (AMC) is responsible for managing the funds pooled from investors. For investment selection and portfolio management, the AMC may hire a fund manager, depending on the fund category.
