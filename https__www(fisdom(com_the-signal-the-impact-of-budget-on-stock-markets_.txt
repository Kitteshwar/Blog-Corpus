In studying figures, it is clear that markets treat Budget as just another event. Appearing dismissive on 1st look, do realize that markets are built to scale up/down on current occurrences till a new event comes its way.The table below looks at how markets reaction over the last 5 years in pre-&-post budget scenarios to fully assess “apparent” impact of budget on markets:As is observed, the effect of budget on market movements dilutes the longer one stretches the time-line from its announcement date.Besides, all budgets are designed to propel the country across all its growth parameters. Hence, as the country grows, so do the markets. As an example, the run-up to 2016 budget saw market participants tense up with many opting for exits as markets contracted by 10%+ in 3 months leading up to the budget. Today, 3 years later, all those who chose to stay invested at the time have enjoyed staggering returns of ~55% on their investments!This link, rather de-link, between markets and budget has been capitalized upon by FIIs as well. In observing the budget’s nature of welcoming health-&-wealth into the country, FIIs have not shyed away from buying into Indian markets.
