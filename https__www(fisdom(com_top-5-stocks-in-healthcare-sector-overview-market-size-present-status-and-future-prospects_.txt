Due to the heightened urgency of healthcare needs during the epidemic, the digital enhancement in the country’s healthcare sector got accelerated further.Did you know?In India, the cost of surgery is only one-tenth that charged in the US. However, India stands at rank 145 among a total of 195 nations with regard to healthcare service quality and accessibility.Growth opportunities in Indian healthcare sectorAs the Covid-19 pandemic has subsided, the Indian healthcare sector may have lost steam for the moment. Here’s what should investors expect from this sector in the near future:India has a population of about 27 crores in the 50+ age group. This size is the fourth largest in the world in terms of age category. Thus, medical products and service consumption in this age group is one of the major factors that will create a huge potential for the sector. Currently, the country’s hospital segment is under-invested. It has the potential for significant investment and expansion. The hospital infrastructure utilisation levels will aid in enhanced profitability in this sector. The COVID-triggered health-insurance demand for enhanced medical cover is also an added plus for this sector. Apart from pharma chains, diagnostic companies may also see strong growth considering the rising demand for the same.Factors that will drive growth in the healthcare sectorSome of the factors that are likely to drive growth in the healthcare sector are:India has already emerged as a competitive hub for global pharma manufacturing, as evidenced by the Covid-19 vaccine supply. This will give a boost to India’s global market share, especially in the US and European markets. Today, the Indian pharma sector exports to more than 100 countries. Thus, the sector’s global market share will continue to rise and allow the country to enjoy a competitive advantage through quality and scale.There is an enhanced backward integration seen in the sector for improving the strength of the supply chain. This is seen to be primarily driven by the government’s Production Linked Incentive scheme benefits that encourage investments in the sector.Possible hindrances to growth in this sectorSome of the roadblocks faced by the sector in its growth journey include insufficient medical personnel, especially in rural India, a meagre health budget sponsored by the government, infrastructural issues, a crumbling public healthcare system, and poor insurance penetration. Top stocks in the Indian healthcare sector based on market capitalisationApollo HospitalsApollo Hospitals is a leading private sector healthcare player that has a vast network with a large chain of hospitals in India.
