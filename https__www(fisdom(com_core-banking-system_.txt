These limitations are highlighted below. High initial investment costThe Core Banking System requires banks and financial institutions to invest in significant assets like the infrastructure and the hardware and software needed for the successful implementation of the banking systems. Such initial investment costs can be quite high, especially for small or medium-sized banks, and can break them even before they get a chance to flourish.Technical and cyber security risksThe security of the customer’s data is of paramount importance in a banking system. This data is often prone to cyber security breaches and other technical risks that can lead to damage or loss of customer data or key banking transactions. Dependence on technology for connectivityThe basis of the Core Banking System is the use of technology for the integration of all the branches of the bank and to provide a seamless banking experience to the customers irrespective of their location. Therefore, CBS has a huge reliance on technology, and any minor or major disruption in the system can lead to a delay in the transfer of funds or in extreme cases, loss of funds or the relevant data. Constant updation to technological advancementsUsers of CBS need to constantly adapt to the changing technical scenario in the banking sector.
