The interest on savings accounts was earlier offered by banks, depending on the minimum balance maintained in the account in a quarter. However, with revised RBI guidelines, banks can now fix higher interest rates on savings accounts. Banks are now free to calculate interest based on the daily account balance and not on the minimum balance maintained. Thus, account owners may earn higher interest amounts per quarter as compared to earlier. If a savings account generates interest amounts more than Rs. 10,000 in a financial year, the account holder can claim a tax deduction only up to Rs. 10,000. The remaining interest received gets added to an individual’s total income and income tax is charged on the same. Here, we will discuss Section 80TTA of the Income Tax act to better understand the interest earnings and associated deductions.
