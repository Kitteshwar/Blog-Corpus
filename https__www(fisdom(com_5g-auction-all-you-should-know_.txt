To put it simply, the 5G network is the latest norm in internet speed, i.e., the fifth generation internet connectivity technology for broadband cellular networks. This network will be available in three bands namely, low-band (600 MHz, 700 MHz, 800 MHz, 900 MHz, 1800 MHz, 2100 MHz, 2300 MHz), mid-band (3300 MHz), and high-band (26GHz) millimeter-wave.This network will provide better connectivity at a higher speed and reduce latency, higher reliability, and a better quality of user experience. The latest network is proposed to provide speeds that are approximately 10 times the current maximum speeds available through the 4G technology. This will help in providing better solutions in areas like internet-connected vehicles, e-health facilities, richer metaverse experiences, life-saving use cases, and advanced mobile cloud gaming experiences. The current speed offered under the 4G network is up to 150mbps and this can go up to 10Gbps under 5G. The upload speed offered by 4G currently on the other hand is up to 50Mbps which is expected to go up to 1Gbps through 5G networks. Also, the 5G network is expected to be able to connect to multiple devices other than smartphones. Which companies are participating in the auction?The announcement of the 5G auction was done after it was approved on June 15 by the Union Cabinet.
