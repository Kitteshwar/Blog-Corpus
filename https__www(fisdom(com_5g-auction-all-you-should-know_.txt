The news around the 5G auction in the country has been awaited for a long time and the government has finally given a green signal for the same. Given below are the details of this 5G spectrum auction, its participants, and core details of the 5G network that is set to change the telecom space in the country for good.   Table of Contents  hide   1 What is 5G technology and how is it better?   2 Which companies are participating in the auction?   3 What are the possible spectrums that are being bid for?   4 When will the 5G network be rolled out in India and where?   5 Conclusion   6 FAQs What is 5G technology and how is it better?We have been hearing about the 4G and 5G networks but what does it really mean? To put it simply, the 5G network is the latest norm in internet speed, i.e., the fifth generation internet connectivity technology for broadband cellular networks. This network will be available in three bands namely, low-band (600 MHz, 700 MHz, 800 MHz, 900 MHz, 1800 MHz, 2100 MHz, 2300 MHz), mid-band (3300 MHz), and high-band (26GHz) millimeter-wave.This network will provide better connectivity at a higher speed and reduce latency, higher reliability, and a better quality of user experience. The latest network is proposed to provide speeds that are approximately 10 times the current maximum speeds available through the 4G technology. This will help in providing better solutions in areas like internet-connected vehicles, e-health facilities, richer metaverse experiences, life-saving use cases, and advanced mobile cloud gaming experiences. The current speed offered under the 4G network is up to 150mbps and this can go up to 10Gbps under 5G. The upload speed offered by 4G currently on the other hand is up to 50Mbps which is expected to go up to 1Gbps through 5G networks. Also, the 5G network is expected to be able to connect to multiple devices other than smartphones. Which companies are participating in the auction?The announcement of the 5G auction was done after it was approved on June 15 by the Union Cabinet. This auction is to be started on July 26 from 10 am to 6 pm and will be carried over the next day if the demand for the spectrum and the bids persist. The auction is for 72 GHz of radiowaves worth Rs 4.3 lakh crore and the Department of Telecom expects to generate Rs. 70,000 crores to Rs.1,00,000 crores from the 5G auctions.

These cities include the metro cities Mumbai, Chennai, Bengaluru, Delhi, and Kolkata along with other cities like Gurugram, Chandigarh, Lucknow, Hyderabad, Pune, Gandhinagar, Jamnagar, and Ahmedabad.
