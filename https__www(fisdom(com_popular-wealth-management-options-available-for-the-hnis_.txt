PMS are tailored to meet individual parameters like risk appetite, returns expectations, investment objective, and time frame. 3. Market-Linked DebenturesMarket-linked debentures (MLDs) are a type of debt instrument that is linked to the performance of a specific underlying asset or basket of assets, such as equity indices, currencies, or commodities. The returns from these investments, therefore, are based on the performance of the underlying assets and can be structured to meet requirements like capital protection. MLDs are typically issued by NBFCs and are issued with a fixed maturity period. While MLDs provide the benefits of diversification and the potential for higher returns they are also equipped with various risks like credit risk, liquidity risks, and more.

Unlisted sharesHNIs can take note of pre-IPO stocks, otherwise known as unlisted shares, as an attractive investment option. These shares are not traded on the stock exchange and are often bought and sold through the Over-the-Counter market (OTC). Investing in unlisted shares allows investors to gain early access to new-age organizations with a focus on technology, innovation, and unique business concepts. Additionally, HNIs/investors can purchase the desired amount of shares based on their investment capacity, which may not be possible during an IPO due to oversubscription causing lower allocations.

Direct investments in equities (Domestic and International)Investing directly in equities is another strategy available for HNIs. It could be investing in the Indian bourses or in international markets. While there is enough information on how you could invest in Indian stocks, investing in international markets is a new avenue that HNIs could consider exploring. Indian HNIs seeking geographical diversification and a hedge against rupee depreciation can look like investing in international stocks. With a lower correlation to Indian markets and access to a broader range of investment options, international investments are becoming an attractive option for HNIs looking to manage risk and portfolio volatility.  Some of the options available include investing through feeder funds or direct investments in stocks, bonds, and structured products. Additionally, for HNIs seeking to establish a financial base in another country, international investments present a compelling opportunity. Dividends from both domestic and international equity investments could also form a part of passive income for HNIs.6. Passive investment optionsETFs and index funds are other lucrative investment options available to HNIs. These funds are low-cost passive funds that have relatively lower risks and the potential for higher returns based on the performance of the benchmark index.

Furthermore, REITs & INvITs are required to distribute 90% of their earnings to unit holders, providing consistent returns. Similarly, this approach is attractive to organizations seeking to monetize real estate or infrastructure assets and can ensure a win-win outcome for both investors and issuers.8.
