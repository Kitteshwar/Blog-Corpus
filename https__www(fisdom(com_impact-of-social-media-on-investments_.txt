Here, we will discuss various factors about the impact of social media on investments, including the benefits and drawbacks of social media for investors.The rise and impact of social mediaMost communication these days are done via social media, ranging from tweets by company CEOs on Twitter to news shared by influencers on Instagram. Every individual who uses a smartphone today is present on at least one social media channel. Social media has become so powerful today that it can impact our everyday lives, whether it is about buying a certain cosmetic product or investing in an upcoming IPO. We millennials prefer to do everything online. So, if we are opening a Demat account and investing in stocks through our smartphones, wouldn’t we prefer to know about the ‘right stocks to invest’ on our smartphones?Did you knowThe popular cryptocurrency Bitcoin’s value rose up by 20% to touch $38,566 at one point. This was attributed to a tweet by the world’s richest person, Elon Musk. He had apparently changed his personal Twitter bio to #bitcoin, and this was taken as an indication of him buying a major chunk of the cryptocurrency. Elon Musk can be safely called an ‘influencer’ on social media since his tweets often impact the stock prices of companies that are connected.Which social media is used by investorsHere are the different social media channels that investors use as per their interest areas:LinkedIn – preferred by 52% of institutional investors, most of who use the platform for weekly updates. YouTube, Facebook – Used by individual investors for information on online trading, learning about investments, etc.Instagram – Used by the youth to access easy-to-interpret information on investment avenues, investment trivia, cost-effective investment platforms, etc.Twitter – Used by investors for seeking opinions and advice, especially market-specific commentary and to stay up-to-date on market events.Pros and cons of social media’s impact on investments The table below talks about the key benefits that investors can draw from social media and also some of the drawbacks that they must beware of:AdvantagesDrawbacksSocial media is a quick and easy medium for communicating ideas, thoughts, and important information.New investors rely entirely on tips shared by social media influencers and avoid self due-diligence.It is easy to use apps for all kinds of investment information at any time and from anywhere.Social media may share modelled investment strategies that may not work for investors. In investment, the concept of ‘one size fits all’ is best avoided.Social media influencers are companies and individuals who people tend to rely upon for advice and opinions on relevant matters. Social media is prone to scams and research/news that may not be valid. Did you knowAs per reports, in the Indian investment scenario, social media scams rose by 156% in recent years and continue to be a medium to carry out malicious activities by fraudsters. 6 individuals were restrained from using social media and fined Rs. 2.84 crores by SEBI. There were found guilty of passing on stock tips via a Telegram channel under the name ‘Intraday Calls – Bull Run Investment Educational Channel’. Their target was to artificially inflate stock prices for quick profits. Social media as a mainstream source of informationThe new generation of investors are exposed to the social world in every aspect of life. With rapid technological advancements, social media is far more updated about the latest happenings that are instantly passed on through engaging content to seekers. As per a recent study, nearly 84% of investors trust recommendations that come from friends and family as compared to other forms of advertising. As people prefer to invest in what is ‘good’ as per peer review, social media is the go-to platform for most investors.ConclusionIt is evident that social media has a significant impact on investments and the influence is only expected to grow over time. Today, “likes” are considered important indicators of an investment or organisation’s worth, with people tracking trending stocks every day.
