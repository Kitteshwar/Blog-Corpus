It is a huge industry that is essentially divided into three main categories and segments. The details of these segments are mentioned below.a. F&BThe Food and Beverage (F&B) segment of the FMCG sector includes an ocean of commodities like health drinks, staples, snacks, chocolates, fruits and vegetables, dairy products, bakery products, branded food products, processed food products, meat, poultry, seafood, bottled water, ice, sugar, confectionery, grains, flour, etc. This industry is quite fragmented and has a number of players but no single company can be considered to have a monopoly or direct the share prices. The driving force for demand and supply of goods in this segment is the demographic of the area, the consumption pattern, and the competition. b. HealthcareHealthcare is the second segment of the FMCG sector.

Investors and traders need to take the help of various tools and techniques of technical and fundamental analysis to pick the best stocks in the industry and ultimately increase their wealth. Some of the basic pointers to understand while picking stocks from the FMCG sector are discussed below.a. Market share of the company and brand value One of the first things to look out for is the name of the company and its brand value. It is also equally important to know the market share of the company in the industry to know its relative position. This will also be an indicator of the customer base and their faith in the company. Investing in such shares can give the investors potentially good returns in the form of dividends or capital gains.b. Diversified productsA company having a wide range of products belonging to the FMCG sector is usually better for investors and shareholders. This helps them tide over in case one of the segments or sub-segments are underperforming. The diversification of the business helps the investors and shareholders reduce their losses at the same time spread their risk. c. Sound distribution network and supply chain management The key to every successful company in the FMCG industry is having a strong distribution network as well as a sound supply chain. The importance of these factors was established clearly during the pandemic related lockdowns when consumers were struggling to get basic essentials. Hence, it is important for the company to have a strong supply chain so the production of the goods is not hampered as well as a widespread distribution network so they can reach the desired customers on a timely basis. d. Strong business model and financial statements of the past 3-5 yearsIt is equally important for the investors and shareholders to focus on the fundamentals of the company. A company with strong fundamentals can easily tide over the short-term market volatility and sustain in the long term. Hence, it is important for the investors and shareholders to track the performance of the company for the past 3 to 5 years approximately.Top FMCG Stocks in India listed on NSEThere are multiple FMCG stocks that are traded on the NSE (National Stock Exchange).
