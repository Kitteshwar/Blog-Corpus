Experts believe that at least 20% of your monthly income should be towards building your retirement fund or such investments that can help you on a rainy day or meet any goal. However, it is often difficult for any person to shell out large sums of money to make such investments. This is where SIPs in mutual funds have an advantage. SIPs or Systematic Investment Plan is the system where the investor can invest a fixed sum of money in specific funds selected by them. Investors can choose the frequency of investment through SIP as per their convenience. This frequency can be daily, weekly, monthly, or quarterly, the amount is debited from the designated bank account of the investor directly at the set date for the period of investment. What are the types of SIP?After knowing the basic meaning of SIPs, the next important thing to know is the type of SIPs. Given below are the details of the same.1. Flexible SIPFlexible SIP is one of the most common types of SIPs in the market. The investor can increase or decrease the amount of SIP easily based on the availability of funds.  2. Perpetual SIPPerpetual SIP, as the name suggests, is when the SIP is started without mentioning any end date. While starting an SIP, the investor has to mention the start date and the end date. If the end date is not mentioned, the sip will continue till the time the investor expressly requests to terminate such SIP. The investor can essentially stay invested as long as they wish3. Trigger SIPSIP in this case is dependent on certain factors that would trigger an upwards or downwards effect in any SIP. Such triggers can be the level of NAV or index level or other similar factors. The investor can mention the end date by submitting a written application to the AMC. 4. Step-Up SIPStep up investment is another form of SIPs where the investor can increase the amount of SIP on a periodic basis. This increase can be set annually or half yearly or at the discretion of the investor. The SIP will then increase by the amount fixed at the set level. Such SIP provides the chance of increasing the investment of the investors with the increase in their income levels.  What are the benefits of SIP?Investing in mutual funds has many benefits, some of such benefits are discussed below.1. Rupee cost averagingThe most effective way of investing in mutual funds is investing when the markets are low and redeeming the units when the markets are on a high. Investors have the possibility to earn high returns in such cases. Investors can purchase the units at different rates and thus have the opportunity to average out the per unit cost of the units. 2. Compounding powerThe advantage of compounding is best gained through SIP. The returns get reinvested and it will benefit in getting more units for the investor. SIPs are, thus, best suited to investors that plan to stay invested for long term.  3. Suitable for investors with low investment budgetSIPs are an ideal investment mode for investors that have a limited investment budget. Such investors can start an SIP with amounts as low as Rs. 500 (Rs.100 in some cases) and can gradually build their portfolio. This helps in meeting long term financial goals with ease without putting a huge hole in the investor’s pocket.4. Inculcates financial discipline Another advantage of SIPs is inculcating a systematic habit to save and invest in the investors. It is quite common for many people to keep pushing the investment requirements to another day till the time it is often too late. Through SIPs the investor does not need to remember the investment date, the amount is regularly auto-debited through the account till the time the investor decides to stop the SIPs. 5. Tax benefitsSIPs provide tax benefits too when the investment is made in tax savings schemes like ELSS. The maximum deduction available to any individual investor is Rs. 1,50,000 under section 80C6. Easy to stop, increase or decreaseInvestors have the benefit of increasing or decreasing the amount invested through SIP. For this, the investor will have to contact the fund house or can start a new SIP for an increased amount with the same fund. How to invest in SIP?Investment in SIP can be done in many ways. Investors can invest in the fund directly through the AMC or through partner banks or directly through their Demat Account. Investors have to first select the mutual fund that they want to invest in after careful research and analysis. Another important factor is to determine the investment budget or the financial goal to be achieved. Investors can start SIPs through the online mode by simply following the above steps and then uploading a few basic KYC documents as required by the fund guidelines.Another easier way of investing in SIPs is through the Fisdom .
