The maximum sum assured under a term insurance plan varies based on many factors like the entry age of the applicant, income and premium paying capacity of the applicant, job profile, etc. What are the different types of term insurance plans?Earlier term insurance plans were quite basic and did not provide many benefits to the insured persons. However, there are various types of term insurance plans available for investment based on the needs of the insured person and their target goals. Some of the common term insurance plans available in the market are discussed below. Level term insurance plansThese are the most basic forms of term insurance plans. The amount of sum assured is fixed at the time of buying the policy and is constant throughout the tenure of the policy. There are no maturity benefits under this plan and the death benefits are paid to the nominee or the legal heir of the insured person. Increasing term insurance plansUnder these plans, the sum assured is gradually increased over the tenure of the policy based on a fixed percentage agreed at the time of taking the policy. The premium on such policies is usually higher. The increasing sum assured over the tenure of the policy ensures that the payout is inflation-adjusted and is sufficient to provide the necessary financial support to the family of the insured person after their death. Decreasing term insurance plansDecreasing term insurance plans are the opposite of increasing term insurance plans where the sum assured is decreased over the tenure of the policy. Such plans are a good option for individuals who have a sound financial plan to finish all long-term liabilities thereby reducing the dependence on the term insurance payout for providing financial security to the family in the event of the death of the insured person. TROP plansThe biggest drawback of a term insurance plan is the lack of maturity benefits. This often drives the applicants away from term insurance plans although it is one of the cheapest forms of insurance available. TROP (Term insurance with return of premium) plans are an answer to this concern. Under this plan, the insured person receives the total premium paid at the end of the policy term if there is no claim made throughout the tenure of the policy.   Convertible term insurance plansThis is a dynamic form of term insurance plan as compared to a basic one. Under this plan, the insured person can convert the term insurance plan into a different type of plan to suit their changing needs. This will help them in meeting their financial targets in an efficient manner.  Watch this video on YouTubeWhat are the features of a term insurance plan?Term insurance plans although a basic form of life insurance provides many features and benefits.

Additionally, under section 10(10D) the nominees or the legal heir of the insured persons also get an exemption from the tax liability on the sum assured received upon the death of the insured person. Multiple payout optionsTerm insurance plans provide multiple payout options to the nominees or the legal heir of the insured person. The payout can be in the form of a lump sum amount or in part payments which are provided at regular intervals as agreed at the time of taking the policy.  ConclusionA term insurance plan is a necessity for every person belonging to any social class.
