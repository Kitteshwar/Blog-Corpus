Just like people prefer to wait for a good quality phone to become cheaper, value investors are often on the lookout for prices of stocks to come down before they invest in them. This, in essence, is value investing.   Table of Contents  hide   1 What are value funds?   2 Benefits of investing in value funds   3 What are the risks of investing in value funds?   4 Tax applicable on value funds   5 Who should invest in value funds?   6 Top-performing value fund recommendations   7 Conclusion   8 FAQs What are value funds?Value funds are a type of mutual funds where the fund manager adopts an investment strategy based on value investing. This involves picking stocks that are experiencing a dip in prices due to temporary movements but have strong fundamentals that have the potential of fetching good returns in the future. In some cases, the stocks may be experiencing a temporary dip in demand. Most value funds invest a minimum of 65% of their pool into equity and related instruments. Benefits of investing in value fundsSome of the noteworthy benefits of investing in value funds are:Value funds offer portfolio diversification benefits to investors, since asset allocation is mostly focused on high growth stocks. Investing in these funds carries lower risk since the portfolio usually has higher safety margins. The undervalued stocks also pose a lower downside risk since they are believed to be trading at a significant discount as compared to their intrinsic value.Another benefit that investors can fetch from these is exposure to various sectors. Value funds exploit market inefficiencies. They buy stocks that are undervalued by the broader market but have a good track record and above-par management. This increases the probability of such stocks being recognised by the broader market in the long run.As the broader market begins to identify the stock’s actual worth, more investors begin investing in them and this results in a steeper price rise. Recommended read – How to analyse a stock to invest better?What are the risks of investing in value funds? Although value funds post lower downside risks, these may pose a value trap for investors. While fund managers may expect the stock prices to move upwards during certain timelines, this may either be delayed or never happen. This could result in the fund selling off the stocks at considerably lower rates. These funds may also consistently underperform for an extended period, especially when markets are on an upward trend.Tax applicable on value fundsValue funds are primarily equity-focused. Therefore, the returns from these are taxable in the same way as equity mutual fund returns. Here are some points to note:Dividends from value funds are added to the total income of the individual and taxable as per the applicable income tax slab.Short term capital gains, i.e, gains from the sale of units within one year from an investment, are taxable at 15% irrespective of the income tax slab of the individual.Long term capital gains, i.e. gains realised from the redemption of units after one year of investment are tax-free up to a maximum of Rs. 1 lakh. Any gains above this amount are taxable at 10% and no indexation benefit can be availed.Who should invest in value funds?Value funds are ideal for investors who want to make the most of price discovery of undervalued stocks that have high growth potential and strong fundamentals. Since price discovery can be a long process, investors who have an investment horizon of at least 5-7 years must consider investing in value funds. This way, they can fetch maximum benefits through a complete investment cycle. Investors can use value funds to limit the downside risk of their investment portfolio during overvalued market conditions. Recommended read – How to avoid loss in stock market?Top-performing value fund recommendationsSome of the top-performing value fund recommendations for 2021 are:1.
