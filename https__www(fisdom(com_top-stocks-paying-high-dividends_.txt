It is important to choose high-quality stocks based on the company’s fundamentals and historical stock performance. Not all dividend-paying stocks may be good investments. Profit and DividendAny company would pay dividends from the profit it generates. If a company is paying a high dividend, it could mean that a significant portion of its profit is going to shareholders. This could result in very little portion being reinvested into the business. Low capital reinvestment can cause slower growth in the future and this can impact the stock price. Therefore, evaluating how a company uses its profits is very crucial to stock selection.No guarantee of dividendsIf a company has paid a dividend in one year or since the past few years, it does not guarantee future dividend payouts. Dividend distribution depends on the company’s profitability and how it uses the profits. Hence, one should not focus only on dividend earnings while shortlisting stocks for investment.Dividends v/s capital growthEven if one invests in top dividend-paying stocks, the amount cannot match up to capital appreciation from good stock investments in the long run. Therefore, an investor must evaluate the possibility of long-term returns from both dividend and capital appreciation of the stock investment. Tax implications of dividend incomeAny dividend income from stocks of an Indian company is taxable in India. For resident shareholders, dividend income from stocks held as investment is taxable under the head of ‘Other Income’ at the applicable tax slab, irrespective of the amount received. Further, under Section 194 of the IT Act, tax will be deducted at source (TDS) at 10% if the dividend income exceeds Rs 5,000 in a financial year.If a shareholder qualifies as a ‘non-resident’ in India under the India income tax law, the dividend income is taxable at 20% plus applicable surcharge and 4% health and education cess on gross basis.ConclusionThe list of top dividend-paying stocks is very dynamic since companies may or may not declare dividends during certain periods. Therefore, while considering stocks from the list mentioned above, investors must not keep dividend payments as the sole criteria for stock selection. To ensure better investment decision-making, investors must look at the holistic picture of a stock, right from company fundamentals, historical stock performance, market sentiments, personal investment goals, and profit utilisation.FAQsWhich metrics should we consider while investing in dividend-paying stocks?Some of the important metrics that investors must consider while investing in dividend-paying stocks include dividend yield, dividend payout ratio, P/E ratio, and earnings per share.Is dividend income taxable in India?Yes, dividend income is taxable in India, as per the applicable income tax slab rates of individual taxpayers.Which is better, long-term capital appreciation or regular dividends?This depends on personal investment strategy and preference. Some investors prefer to invest for long-term capital appreciation, as they have a longer investment horizon. Many investors prefer dividend earnings for regular income.How does dividend distribution impact stock prices?When a company declares dividend, in the short run, it may see a rise in the stock prices and investors demand more stocks in the hope of future dividends. However, the prices of such stocks may fall after the expiry of dividend eligibility date since fewer investors may demand the stock.Share the article                      Get exclusive content
