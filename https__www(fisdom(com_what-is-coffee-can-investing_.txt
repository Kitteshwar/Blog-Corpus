Under this strategy, investors invest in quality stocks by applying certain parameters to ascertain their viability and growth trajectory and follow the buy and forget principle. These stocks or investments are bought with a long-term investment horizon of more than 10 years. This long-term investment horizon allows the investment to grow multifold and the investors do not need to worry about short-term volatility. Most Indian women have been applying this strategy of saving even without knowing its name or relevance on the global platform or stock markets. In the olden days, Indian women would store extra cash in grain containers as part of their savings which could be later used in times of emergency. While the concept is similar to this ancient practice, instead of grain containers, the investment is now held in the Demat account of the investors. What is the origin of coffee can investing? The origin of the coffee can investing strategy can be found in America. In the olden days in the country, people would store important documents or assets in coffee cans and would bury them for safekeeping. This was way before the concept and banks came into the picture and banks became popular. In those days, storing the valuables in a coffee can for safekeeping was the norm. Most people would often forget about their savings in the coffee can or would not touch them for decades. In 1960, Mr. Robert Kirby had advised his client to invest in some stocks and had never sold them eventually. When the client passed away that investment had increased significantly and amounted to significant wealth. This gave Mr. Kirby an idea and he coined this buy and forget strategy as the coffee can strategy in 1984. Under this strategy, investors are advised to purchase significant shares of a company that has a sound business plan and good growth trajectory for a significant amount of years. These investments should be held for a period of at least 10 to 15 years to generate substantial returns. How to apply the coffee can investing strategy in Indian markets? The coffee can strategy was introduced in the Indian stock markets by Mr. Sourabh Mukherjee through his book ‘Coffee Can Investing’ and Ambit Capital, India’s leading financial advisors. There have been established parameters that can be used to create a successful coffee can portfolio that can not only beat the benchmark but also provide annualized returns more than most successful dynamic investment options. Some of the important parameters set under this strategy are highlighted below. Investors should Target companies that have a market capitalization of a minimum of Rs. 100 crores. The return on capital employed (ROCE) of the company should be at least 15%The revenue growth of the company should be a minimum of 10%.
