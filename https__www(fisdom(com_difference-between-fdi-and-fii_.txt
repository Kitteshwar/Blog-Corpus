It is constantly needed to keep the wheels of the company rolling and ultimately meet the bottom line of generating profits for the shareholders. A company can need finance for various purposes like expansion, diversification, purchase of a new plant and machinery, meeting working capital needs, paying off short-term or long-term liabilities, etc. One of the many sources of finances for Indian companies is the funds received from foreign sources. This can be from individual investors or companies or organizations located outside India. Such investments by foreign entities are known as FDI and FII. In the last few decades, Indian Companies have seen tremendous growth and the country is also one of the topmost emerging markets in the world. Also, post the initial slump in the Indian markets after the pandemic, the Indian economy has bounced back faster as compared to many other economies. This has further increased the investment opportunities for foreign investors who aim to benefit from this economic boom and earn higher returns as compared to investments in developed countries or other emerging markets. Given below is the basic meaning of these two main sources of foreign investments, FDI and FII, as well as the key differences between the two.

The purpose of the investment is to gain long-lasting control or influence over the foreign company. FDI is a crucial form of acquiring external finance, especially for countries with limited financial resources. Foreign investors can gain controlling ownership through methods such as merger/acquisition, share purchase, joint venture, or by incorporating a wholly-owned subsidiary.Definition of FIIFII stands for Foreign Institutional Investor. FIIs are a group of investors who pool their money to invest in foreign assets. FII is a quick way for investors to make money and includes institutions such as banks, mutual funds, insurance companies, and hedge funds. To invest, FII must be registered with the securities exchange board of the target country. FII plays a crucial role in a country’s economy, with market trends influenced by the presence or absence of their investment.Key Differences Between FDI and FIIKey differences between FDI and FII are:FDI involves a direct investment in a company with the intention of acquiring management control or influence, while FII involves investment in securities or assets of a foreign company.FDI results in a long-term interest in the investee company, whereas FII investment is usually short-term and focused on the secondary market.FDI is subject to stricter regulations compared to FII, which allows for a relatively easy entry and exit from investment.FDI brings in not just finance, but also technical knowledge and direct involvement in the day-to-day operations of the foreign company, while FII investment primarily provides financial benefits.The maximum permissible investment by an FII in an Indian company is 24% of the paid-up capital, with a 2% lower cut-off, while there is no such limit for FDI.FDI is considered a more stable form of foreign investment as compared to FII, which is known as “hot money” due to its quick entry and exit from investments.ConclusionFDIs and FIIs are both crucial forms of investment for any Indian company. It also creates an attractive investment opportunity for foreign investors and gives a boost to the growth and development of the company ultimately benefiting the shareholders. However, investment in the form of FDI is preferred by Indian companies as it brings a lot more to the company than simply capital inflow as in the case of FIIs. FAQs1.
