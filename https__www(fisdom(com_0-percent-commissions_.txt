The cost involved in investing and managing the investments plays a big role in determining your returns. Mutual funds have assumed a popular way of investing both for long term and short term goals because mutual funds come across as a low-cost, easy to invest, and professionally managed option for investing. Various investor awareness programs like Mutual Fund Sahi Hai by the Association of Mutual Funds in India have played a big role in promoting the growth of mutual funds in India. Let’s see how a 0% commission mutual fund platform like Fisdom  can help you better returns on your mutual fund investment. While investing in mutual funds expense ratio of mutual funds has an important role in your end returns. Expense ratio is one of the costs involved with investing in mutual funds. 0% Commissions & No fees on FisdomFisdom  is an app-based investment platform where you can easily invest in all sorts of mutual funds like Equity Funds, Debt mutual fund, Hybrid Funds or Solution Oriented funds for free on an app available on the Playstore or AppStore. In addition to investing, you can also avail yourself intelligent features like tracking your external portfolio, get smart engine based fund recommendations based on your risk profile, set goals, and plan towards that and much more all at 0% commission and no fees. How do 0% commissions work on mutual funds?Mutual funds can be categorised into two types based on their expense ratios.Direct plansRegular plans.The basic difference between direct and regular plans is that Direct Plans have 0% commissions paid out to mutual fund distributors/ agents / or any 3rd party. Fisdom  only supports Direct Plans of Mutual Funds. Direct plans of mutual funds were introduced by SEBI in 2013.How do 0% commissions work in Direct Mutual Funds?The basic difference between direct and regular plans is in the Total Expense Ratio charged to the scheme. Total Expense Ratio (TER) is the percentage of expense charged to the scheme, which is applied to the investor’s portfolio value.The TER comprises three components:Fund management expenseAdministrative expenseDistributor commission.Fund management and administrative expense are mandatory expenses charged by the AMC or the fund house to manage that particular mutual fund in accordance with its investment objective. In addition, the AMC also pays the mutual fund distributors/agents some amount of commission in regular plans of mutual funds. But in direct mutual funds, the Total Expense Ratio does not include distributor commission (and is lowered to that extent) as the investments are made directly with the AMC or the fund house. How much difference does 0% commissions make to my portfolio’s returns?A direct plan is for investors who want to invest directly in the mutual fund without routing the investment through a distributor. The plan will have a lower expense ratio since there are no distribution expenses or commissions involved. The plan will have a separate NAV that will reflect the lower expenses. However, the difference between the expense ratio of a regular plan and a direct plan might be a mere 1%-1.5%, but if you are long-term investor even a difference of 1.5% creates a huge difference over a period.Let’s check out some examples to see what is the difference in the returns between regular and direct mutual fund plans of some selected funds. Comparison of returns from 0% commission direct mutual fund plan and regular plan of a fund ICICI Pru BluechipICICI Prudential Bluechip Fund is one of the prime mutual funds offered by ICICI Prudential Mutual Funds.
