When the economy and market are on a boom, growth stocks provide maximum returns on investment. These stocks are high-growth-oriented companies that usually earn high profits from their business. These profits are not usually distributed to the shareholders but are reinvested in the business to increase the profitability of the business and ultimately the EPS (Earnings Per Share) of the shares. What are the features of growth stocks?Growth stocks have quite particular characteristics that make them very attractive investment options for investors. Some of the main features of growth stocks are mentioned below.Return on investment The returns on investment in growth stocks are the highest as compared to similar stocks in the industry. These stocks do not provide high dividends to the investors. The profits are usually reinvested in the business to increase its profitability. Also, the return on investment in growth stocks is not too high in the short term. The growth rate of these stocks is quite higher than the average market growth rate. The capital gains on these growth stocks are quite substantial in the long term on account of the high growth rate of the business and ultimately their stocks. Risk of investmentThe returns on investment in growth stocks are high and the risk of such investment is also quite high. The risk of investment is especially high in short-term investments. Growth stocks fail in rare cases and hence the risk is lowered significantly in the long run. In the short term, the returns in the form of capital gains are not significant and the dividends are usually not declared by the company. Hence the risk of investment in the short term is significantly higher in the case of growth stocks as compared to other stocks or investment options for a similar duration. Growth rateThe growth stocks have the highest rate of growth among all types of stocks available in the market. Investment in these stocks yields the highest rate of return in the long term. The growth rate is nominal in the short term but is usually higher than the market average.Advantage over competitors Growth stocks usually have a unique business model that provides them some advantage over their competitors. This advantage yields increased profitability eventually leading to higher growth. This advantage over competitors is quite essential for the business to grow as well as maintain its high growth rate and eventually become a market leader.Loyal customer baseGrowth stocks enjoy the benefit of a loyal customer base on account of their competitive advantage. The increasing business opportunities and the USP of the business of growth stocks allow the company to enjoy a loyal customer base that prefers them over their competition.What are the pros and cons of growth stocks?Growth stocks have many advantages and disadvantages over other stocks in the same industry or segment.

Given below are a few pointers that can help them choose better growth stocks and increase their wealth in the long term.Small-cap or mid-cap stocksCompanies with high growth potential are usually from the small-cap or mid-cap segment. These stocks have sound growth projections for the company and have a unique product or service that provides them with a niche in the market.Higher return on equityThe return on equity of growth stocks is usually higher than the market average. Growth stocks prefer to reinvest the profits earned back into the company to generate higher profitability. This eventually increases the return on equity for the investors. If a company is not able to provide a higher return on equity despite reinvesting the profits earned, such a company is better off distributing the profits to its shareholders in the form of dividends.Dividend payout ratioThe key feature of a growth company is the reinvestment of profits into the business to increase the profitability of the business. In most cases, growth stocks have the maximum dividend payout ratio of up to 50%. Management of the companyThe management of the company is another important factor that has to be considered while picking growth stocks. The management of the company has to be capable of navigating the company finances to steer them in the best way to generate constant profitability and provide better returns on the growth stocks.Tracking of the performance of the company for evidence of growth potentialThe growth potential of a company is dependent on many factors that have to be constantly monitored. The evidence needed should be tangible and supported by factual figures and documentation. This is necessary for the investors to avoid any misguided decisions made on account of the window dressing of financial statements by the management of the company.Strong financial statements of the companyThe financial statements of the company have to be quite strong to project the financial stability of the business. The classic features of strong financial statements of a business are,Strong cash position so the working capital of the company is not affectedComfortable debt position which does not endanger the existence of the companyStrong assets and investments of the company that can back the future growth projections of the company. ConclusionGrowth stocks have the potential to increase the investor’s wealth exponentially as compared to many stable stocks and current industry giants.
