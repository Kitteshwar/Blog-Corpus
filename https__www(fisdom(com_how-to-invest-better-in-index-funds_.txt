Since this requires time, effort, and substantial understanding of the markets, the fund will charge a management fee for investing in actively managed mutual funds. Passively managed funds like index funds, on the other hand, involve a strategy that requires a fund manager to set up a portfolio of investments reflecting the benchmark index. However, since the fund will only track the index, there is no active role of the fund manager. The performance of the index fund will mirror the index performance, thus eliminating substantial management fees, also known as the expense ratio. Reasons to invest in index fundsIndex fund investments are easy and one of the most cost-effective wealth creation avenues for investors. By tracking and mirroring the performance of the financial markets, index funds can offer positive returns in the long run without requiring an investor to constantly monitor it.Here are some of the top reasons why investing in index funds can be a sensible decision:Easier decision makingMinimal research time required since there is no need for an investor to evaluate individual stocks.

Overall returns from these funds do not get much impacted by short-term market movements.Things to consider before investing in index fundsDespite the benefits listed above, index funds may not suit all investor expectations. Hence, some of the points that investors should consider before investing in them are:Since index funds track the index, these cannot beat the market. They are designed to mirror the market’s performance and investors who expect comparatively superior returns should reconsider investing in these.Investors should note that there is no loss protection in index fund investments.

Therefore, when the market plunges, the index fund returns will also plunge.It is not necessary that an investor will own stocks that he/she is interested in as far as index fund investments are concerned. The fund’s stock composition is entirely based on the index composition.ConclusionIndex funds continue to attract more investors as people prefer to follow the market instead of beating the market in the long run.
