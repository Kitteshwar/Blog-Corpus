Some of the top government initiatives are highlighted below. Mandatory BIS-like certification for imported chemicals to avoid sub-standard and cheap chemicals being dumped in the country. Allocation of US$ 27.43 million to the Department of Chemicals and Petrochemicals under the budget of FY 22-23Plans to launch a production-link incentive system with 10-20% output incentives for the agrochemical sector under the 2034 vision of the government that aims to reduce imports, boost domestic production and attract more investments in the sector. Other incentives in this sector include 100% tax exemption on export income for SEZ units for the first five years, 50% for the next five years thereafter, and 50% of the export profit that is invested back into the business for the next five years. This scheme is set to come into effect from 1st April 2020.To boost the ease of doing business in the country and to do away with unnecessary bureaucracy, the government has also proposed a single window clearance for central and state-level approvals.Under the revised PCPIR (Petroleum, Chemicals and Petrochemicals Investment Region) policy for 2020-2035, a combined investment of US$ 142 billion is targeted by 2025, followed by US$ 213 billion by 2030 and finally US$ 284 billion by 2035 in all PCPIRs across the country. This investment is expected to generate employment for approximately 33.83 lakh people.  Investments and major announcements in the chemicals sectorInvestments in the chemical sector have seen a huge increase from the national as well as the international front. Recognizing the growing importance of the chemicals industry in the country’s GDP, the government has increased the permissible levels of FDI in this sector to 100%. The total FDI inflow in chemicals other than fertilizers is to the tune of US$ 19 million in the period between April 2000 to March 2022 which accounts for approximately 3.3% of the total FDI inflow. .

Some of the key challenges faced by the sector are mentioned below. Shortage of raw materialsThe prime challenge for the chemicals industry is the timely availability of raw materials. The cost of the feedstock of thej raw material for the industry especially naphtha and natural gas at available at a cheaper rate in other countries like South East Asian Countries, the Middle East, China, etc, as compared to their cost in India. This increase in the cost of the raw materials is trickled down into the final cost of the product which makes it uncompetitive for the Indian manufacturers and traders.   Tough competition from imports Indian Government on account of many bilateral agreements with many nations has reduced the cost of imports from various nations. This has introduced an influx of quality chemicals at a cheaper rate which is a further blow to the Indian chemicals industry.Logistical issuesMost of the chemicals industry in India is located on the western coast of Gujarat due to its proximity to raw materials and ports. However, the demand for most of the chemicals comes from the southern and the eastern belt. This creates logistical issues and increases the transport cost which is at its peak given the rising crude prices. Poor warehousingIndia even today faces many connectivity issues like restricted access to railways, ports, adequate pipelines, etc. The warehouses for the chemicals also face poor infrastructure issues, lack of adequate power connection, and facilities in case of any disasters. This adds to the worries of the chemicals sector, ultimately affecting productivity and quality. Lack of adequate investment in R&DThe chemicals sector is quite fragmented and has huge volumes coming from the small and medium enterprises sector. These businesses lack the financial support necessary for research and development in the sector that can result in innovation or improvement in the quality of output thereby ultimately losing out to the global competition.   Lack of skilled labourIndian markets have faced the issue of lack of skilled labour in almost every sector. There need to be fundamental changes in the quality and the pattern of education provided at the grass root levels to tackle this problem. The lack of skilled labour in the chemicals industry leads to inadequate quality of production or increased time in the manufacturing process, decreased productivity, as well a lack of growth opportunities for the businesses. Future prospects in the sectorIndia has a huge chemicals belt in the southern and the western part of the country which will have a greater national and international exposure owing to the increased demand. India is also set to gain in the post-pandemic period on account of the supply chain disruptions in China and the growing trade conflicts between the West and China. The government of the country is also lending its crucial support to the sector in the form of incentives and tax breaks as well as the development of dedicated infrastructure under the PCPIR policy and investment for the same to the tune of US$276.46 million by 2035. Top stocks in the chemical sector based on Market capitalizationThe key players in the chemicals sector in the country based on their market capitalization are highlighted below as of June 2022Pidilite IndustriesPidilite is the biggest name in the chemicals sector in the country and has a variety of products in segments like adhesives and sealants, construction chemicals, craftsmen products, DIY products, and polymer emulsions.
