Until May’22, companies had raised about Rs 1.96 trillion as per statistics released by PRIME Database. This amount is down by 23.4% from the previous year’s Rs 2.56 trillion raised through private placements. The drop is mainly attributed to lower fund requirements and rising interest rates.Why is private placement used by companies?Some of the top reasons why many companies prefer to raise funds via this route are:No stringent rules to be followedCompanies use this mode mainly to generate capital from wealthy individual investors and institutions. This way, they can avoid the rigorous process involved in raising capital from public. Private placement often lacks transparency and there are no restrictive rules regarding disclosure to public. Can be used at any stageIrrespective of whether a company is in project initiation stage or has reached maturity in its business cycle, it can raise funds through private placement without any restriction. This may not be possible if raising capital through banks or from the public since there will be detailed scrutiny on the phase of business and why it requires funds.Enhanced knowledge of private equity investorsSince private placements mostly involve private equity players who are experts in certain fields, their knowledge and network can aid the company in achieving faster success.

Companies should also note that private placement can only be made to select persons or entities and cannot involve public advertisements or media channels to notify the public about such offers. FAQsAre private placements economical for companies?Yes, private placements are considered economical since a company does not have to spend on prospectus, application forms and other mandatory requirements involved in a public issue.Can companies enjoy confidentiality in private placements?Since shares are allotted to selected individuals or entities in a private placement, companies can keep the procedure confidential as there is no need to make the information public.Can private placements be used by listed companies?Yes, private placements can also be used by listed companies to raise capital for specific business needs, especially during maturity phases when it is difficult to raise funds from financial institutions or public.Is there a maximum limit for raising funds through private placement?The maximum number of participants in a private placement can be 200 people.
