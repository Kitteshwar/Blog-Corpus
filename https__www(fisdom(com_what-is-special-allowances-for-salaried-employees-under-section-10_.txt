Let’s see how the section defines special allowance.A special allowance or benefit is a part of an employee’s salary that is given to an employee towards certain expenses that are incurred specifically for carrying out his/her employment duties. It can also include an allowance given to an employee for meeting personal expenses during employment and compensation for the high cost of living. Such an allowance is exempt from tax.There is a common misconception that special allowance is something like variable income. However, it is in fact a part of an employee’s gross salary. Additionally, the amount and allocation of a special allowance differs across companies and depends on each company’s internal policy. Hence, while company A may give all its employees a special allowance but that may not be true for Company B.Section 10 (14) of the Income tax actSection 10 (14) of the Income Tax Act is a crucial provision that exempts certain allowances from tax.Section 10 (14) (i)The section covers a wide range of allowances, including travel, daily expenses, and conveyance allowances under Section 10 (14) (i). These allowances are given to employees to meet their daily expenses related to travel and conveyance.Section 10 (14) (ii)Section 10 (14) (ii) covers allowances for official duties such as uniforms, research, and other special allowances. These allowances are exempt from tax up to a specified limit, and the remaining amount is taxable.Tax on special allowanceThe table below talks about special allowance categories and related exemptions that employees can avail as per Section 10:Special allowance categories ExemptionsTransport allowanceHandicapped employees can claim an exemption of up to Rs. 3,200.Hostel AllowanceExemption limit is Rs.300 per month per child for up to 2 children.Helper AllowanceThose who may have hired an assistant for fulfilling their employment duties can claim an exemption for such expenses incurred.Daily AllowanceAny expenses incurred towards touring for employment can be claimed for tax exemption.Children’s Education AllowanceChildren’s education expenses can be claimed as an exemption for a maximum Rs.100 per month per child for 2 children.Tribal Area Allowance: Residents of hilly areas, scheduled, and agency areas including Odisha, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Assam, and Tripura can claim tax exemption of up to Rs. 200 per month.Uniform Allowance: Expenses incurred for buying and maintaining employment uniform can be claimed as tax exemption.Outstation Allowance: Maximum allowance can be Rs. 10,000 and maximum exemption can be Rs. 10,000 or 70%, whichever is lower.Academic/Research Allowance: Academic/research allowance from employer can be claimed for tax exemption.Island Duty Allowance: Members of the armed forces who have been assigned duties in Lakshadweep and Andaman & Nicobar can claim a maximum tax exemption of up to Rs. 3,250 per month.Travelling Allowance: Cost of travel for executing duty in another city can be claimed for tax exemption.How is special allowance calculated for tax?If an employee wants to estimate the taxability on the special allowance received by him/her, the first step is to estimate the total amount received under the segment special allowance in the salary slip. All the amounts in this category must be summed up depending on what is offered to an individual by the employer.Special allowance categories can be divided into 2 parts. Certain type of special allowances are fully taxable and some are either partially tax exempt or fully tax exempt. Some of the conditions that must be met for claiming tax exemption on special allowance are:The payment from employer should not be a perkAllowance cannot be of a personal natureIt must be granted solely for meeting expenses that are incurred for carrying out employment duties Maximum amount that can be claimed as the tax exemption is limited to the amount received and spent for the purpose mentionedConclusionWhile Section 10 of the Income Tax Act states the limit for tax exemption, it does not prescribe any upper limit for special allowance than can be granted by employers to their employees.
