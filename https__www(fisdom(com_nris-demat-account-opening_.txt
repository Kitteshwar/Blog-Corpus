Before learning about the process to open a Demat account by an NRI, let us first understand who exactly is an NRI.The term NRI is defined as per the provisions of FEMA (Foreign Exchange Management Act) as well as the Income Tax Act. According to FEMA, an NRI is a person resident outside India who is either a citizen of India, an Overseas Citizen of India (OCI), or a Person of Indian Origin (PIO). Whereas as per the Income Tax Act, NRIs can be defined as under,When a person stays in India for a period of less than 182 days. When a person resides in India for a period of less than 60 days on a continuous basis or a period of 365 days in four years preceding the current year in consideration.It includes any Indian Citizen or any person of Indian origin who stays outside India for the purpose of employment or education.What is an NRI Demat Account?Like the ordinary Demat account an NRI Demat account is also a digital space where the dematerialized shares of a company and other securities like mutual fund units, bonds, etc owned by an NRI are held electronically. NRIs can open a trading account as well as a Demat account after the approval of the central bank. NRIs can invest in the Indian share market through the Portfolio Investment Scheme (PIS). This investment can be done on a repatriation and non-repatriation basis. NRI investments through PIS are mandatory as all the NRI investments need to be reported to the apex bank. This scheme allows the NRIs to invest in shares and debentures directly from the recognized stock exchange by using their bank account and their nominated branch. What are the types of NRI Demat Accounts?NRI accounts, unlike regular or standard Demat accounts, are essentially of two basic types. The details of these accounts are mentioned below.NRE Demat account NRE Demat is the Non-Resident External Demat account. This account can be used by the NRIs to buy and sell shares and other similar securities on a repatriable basis which means that the proceeds can be transferred abroad to their place of residence. NRIs have to route their investment in the share market through PIS through the NRE Demat account. Through an NRE Demat account, NRIs can repatriate both principal and the interest amount generated on the investment. Also, NRIs can hold a maximum of up to 5% of the paid-up capital in any Indian company. Investment in any IPO by an NRI can also be done through the NRE accounts.NRO Demat accountNRO Demat account i.e., the Non-Resident Ordinary account is used to trade in shares and other securities like futures and options on a non-repatriable basis. Non-repatriable basis implies that not all the proceeds from the trades or investment through this account are eligible for a transfer by the NRIs to their country of residence. NRIs are permitted to transfer a maximum amount of $1 million of their funds abroad in any financial year. Investment in an NRO account is free from the PIS route that is otherwise mandatory for NRE accounts. It is to be noted that the principal amount has to be repatriated after payment of taxes and the interest amount can be repatriated after payment of TDS on such amount. How to open an NRI Demat account?There are many ways that an NRI can open their NRI Demat account i.e. with any Depository Participant or with any registered stockbroker as well as any Bank that is registered with NSDL and CDSL.
