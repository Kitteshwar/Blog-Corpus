At the same time, persistent attempts are being made to keep the economies buoyant. India seems to be managing both fronts better than most global counterparts. The same is reflected in the increasing number of patients recovering from covid-19 as well as maintaining lowest death rates in among countries with 1 million+ total cases, India is fighting the covid-19 battle in an admirable way. The country has not only restricted itself to curbing virus effect on the health of its citizens, it has also curbed the effects on the economy. On the economic front, despite most lockdown restrictions still being In force in many cities, the macroeconomic indicators reflect resilience.Here are a couple of green shoots visible at the moment.Green Shoot 1: Industrial/ Construction activity, though largely in contractionary phase, has started looking up.Green Shoot 2: Uptick in high-frequency indicators; will take time for a complete reboundGreen Shoot 3: Rainfall Pattern in subdivisions – Good monsoon progress; A sigh of relief for rural consumersOut of 36 sub-divisions, nearly 82% of the sub-divisions have reported a higher-than-average monsoon.Bottom line:Though numbers may not have reached pre-covid levels, there’s merit in acknowledging that the uptick is in the face of continued (but diminishing) adversity. Unlock 1.0 has resulted in visible green shoots spurting out of the slump. As the world progresses in its fight against the pandemic, India looks promisingly strong in terms of public health & investor wealthIt is almost imperative that investors utilize times like now as opportunities to buy through systematic routes like Systematic Investment Plans & Systematic Transfer Plans.Food for Thought:  India on track to be among the top three economies in the world  FeaturedThe Signal  The Signal – Budget FY24: Expectations 28 Jan  6 minutes   The Signal  The Signal: Adani Enterprise FPO- Battle between value and valuation 21 Jan  4 minutes   FeaturedThe Signal  The Signal- Attrition Declines, Margins improve: Road Ahead For IT 14 Jan  6 minutes   The Signal  The Signal: Decoding India’s manufacturing push 07 Jan  4 minutes   The Signal  The Signal: MF Industry – Key Milestones and Trends 31 Dec  4 minutes   The Signal  The Signal: Steely resolve to outperform 17 Dec  5 minutes   The Signal  The Signal: Big Plays with Big Tech 10 Dec  7 minutes   The Signal  MPC Update December-22 07 Dec  2 minutes   The Signal  The Signal: Decoding the NIFTY 50 all-time high for you 03 Dec  5 minutes   The Signal  The Signal: IPO – Initial Public Opportunity? 26 Nov  5 minutes   The Signal  The Signal: Hotel stocks gain traction as restrictions ease 19 Nov  5 minutes   The Signal  The Signal: Q2 earnings season: Hits & Misses 05 Nov  4 minutes
