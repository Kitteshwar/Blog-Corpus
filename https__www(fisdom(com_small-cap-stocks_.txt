This causes frequent volatility. These stocks tend to underperform large and mid-cap stocks during market downturns. Small-cap stocks may, however, outperform large and mid-cap categories during a bull market.High riskSmall-cap stocks are of companies that have not yet established a market presence. These companies often have limited cash reserves. Thus, there are higher chances of these companies having negative cash flows in case of economic slowdowns. Because of this, small cap companies pose a higher risk of going bankrupt in case of economic slowdowns.Substantial potential for growthIn stock markets, risk and returns tend to go hand in hand. Since small-cap stocks are high on risks, they also tend to have significant potential for growth. The growth opportunities offered by small-cap stocks are not often available in large-cap stocks.Low liquiditySmall-cap stocks offer lower liquidity when compared to large or midcap stocks. This is mainly because these stocks find very few investors who would like to trade in them.

This depends on the fund’s objective. Most small-cap companies may not form part of mutual funds since they have a limited number of stocks available. Therefore, these are ideal for individual investors who can identify a growth opportunity and invest before the general market gets interested in them.Long-term value correctionSmall-cap stocks do not attract much attention from analysts and markets pay very little attention to these in general. This results in the stocks being undervalued as compared to large- and mid-cap stocks. Thus, the small cap share prices could be far lower than their true value. In the long term, the market valuation may be correct to reflect its true value and an early investor can book large profits in such cases.Additional read – How to analyse a stock to invest better?Strategies for investing in small-cap stocksFor investors who are just beginning to explore the stock markets, an ideal way to start exploring small-cap stocks is by investing in small-cap mutual funds.
