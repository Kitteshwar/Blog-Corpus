I am not saying we maintain a Panglossian outlook and smile at everything — I don’t expect people to smile away difficulty — but a mood of doom and gloom will not help anyone,”-Shaktikanta Das Governor, RBIDesperate times call for desperate measures.This has never been more than in recent times. With India staring at the incoming wave of a global slowdown, the two biggest forces – Ministry of Finance and Reserve Bank of India have decided to keep their long-standing feud aside and attempt to insulate India through growth-inducing measures, reforms, and policies.Over the past couple of weeks, Nirmala Sitharaman had announced a slew of big-bang measures including rollback of the controversial surcharge on equity capital gains, intent to recapitalise public sector banks, dispose angel tax, fast-track GST refunds while the generally conservative RBI decided to move out of its comfort zone and pay out a surprisingly large sum of INR 1.76 lakh crore.While these measures are expected to be instrumental in the economy, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman chose to not wait for more data and in fact acted proactively by calling for another press conference late Friday this week with another set of surprises.
