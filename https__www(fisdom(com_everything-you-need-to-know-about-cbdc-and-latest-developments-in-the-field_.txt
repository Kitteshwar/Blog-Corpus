Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has since made CBDC the latest buzzword across financial news and networks, although the common man remains unfamiliar with this term.Most of us have heard about cryptocurrency, but what exactly is CBDC and how does it work? Here’s what you need to know about CBDC and some of the latest developments surrounding this concept.What is CBDC? CBDC is short for Central Bank Digital Currency. This is a form of digital currency that is government-issued and backed by the central bank of a country. Just like a country’s physical currency, the CBDC will act as a medium of exchange, store of value, deferred payment standard, and unit of account. India’s central bank, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) plans to roll out this digital currency in 2023. Although CBDC will be a legal tender issued by the central bank, it will be in digital form. It will act as an electronic record or digital token of the country’s official currency, which is the Rupee.Did you knowIn 2021, there was a survey conducted by the Bank of International Settlements (BIS) on digital currency.

However, these are unregulated and, in some countries, even illegal. Since the advent and increased popularity of unregulated cryptos, central banks across the globe are seeing reduced usage of paper currency. Therefore, there is a need to popularize a more legitimate and acceptable electronic currency format.Since CBDC will be backed by distributed ledger technology (DLT) and based on a permissioned blockchain, it will carry more authenticity as compared to permission-less crypto assets. Central monetary authority of a country, in India’s case, the RBI will have control access to the blockchain. Digital currency will therefore offer better efficiency and, with its launch, the country’s monetary system can avoid any negative impact of private currencies like Bitcoin.Benefits of CBDCSome of the benefits expected out of CBDC are:CBDCs will be equivalent to fiat currencies. Therefore, the transactions will be legal and final, thereby eliminating any risk of settlement in the financial system, especially for banks. It will act as a value storehouse that will further transfer the value across entities. It is expected to involve lower transaction costs and enable the easy flow of funds.It will enable faster settlement as compared to physical money. Real-time local and global transactions will be possible through this system. There will be no hindrances like time zone differences since these will not matter in currency settlements. CBDC also holds the potential to offer better liquidity and scalability. This is because, as compared to private digital currencies, it will have better acceptance and ease of transactions. Latest news – CBDC Wholesale and Retail pilotsThe pilot project of CBDC Wholesale segment started on 01 Nov, 2022 and was limited to the settlement of secondary market transactions in government securities.
