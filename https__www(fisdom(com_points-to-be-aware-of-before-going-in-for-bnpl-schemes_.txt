BNPL refers to ‘Buy Now Pay Later‘ and as the name suggests, it is a form of financial avenue that lets customers purchase something now and pay for it later. The BNPL provider pays for the purchased item immediately on behalf of the customer and the customer in turn has to repay the BNPL provider with an interest free period of 3 or more instalments depending on the guidelines of the BNPL provider and the arrangement between them and the customer. It is an attractive payment option for young new to credit customers who may not have credit cards or debit cards and require easy access to funds for small purchases. BNPL credit is an interest free option and hence is attracting even customers who have access to dedicated credit lines. The BNPL provider requires the customer to complete the necessary KYC on their portal and determine the creditworthiness of the customer based on the analysis of their purchasing and repayment pattern. The credit line offered by most portals ranges from Rs. 500 to Rs. 30,000 (or more) and a credit period of 15 days to 120 days approximately depending on their individual guidelines. Some of the popular BNPL providers include Amazon Pay, Flipkart, HDFC Bank ICICI Bank, Kissht, Simpl, ZestMoney, Moneytap, LazyPay, PayTm, PhonePe, etc. What are the advantages of BNPL?Some of the advantages of the BNPL schemes that make it lucrative to the masses are highlighted below. BNPL allows customers access to instant credit lines, especially new customers with virtually no credit history.Customers can choose from the multiple flexible repayment options to suit individual payment patternsBNPL portals have helped to increase the affordability for customersSafety and security of transactions as well as transparency of transactions due to the technologically advanced fintech portals makes it more attractive for the techno savvy customers of today thereby providing a smooth and hassle-free experience.BNPL portals also help in building a sound credit history of the customer without the need for a credit card based on their transactions and repayment history with the portal. What are the risks in BNPL?Like any other technological advancement, BNPL also has its own share of risks and limitations.

Therefore, the interest rate policy offered by the BNPL providers should be reviewed before opting it. Repayment options available Another important aspect to be considered is the repayment policy offered by the BNPL provider. The customer needs to understand if prepayment or part payment options are available on the outstanding amount and if so are there any charges levied on the same. Access to multiple vendors or merchants The success of the BNPL provider is measured in its reach not only from the customer point of view but also from the merchants.
