Under this scheme, the employer and the employee contribute a small portion i.e. a percentage of the earnings of the employee towards this fund.

As the Covid 19 situation has been declared a pandemic, the members of the EPF are allowed an emergency withdrawal from the fund. Such withdrawal is considered to be a non-refundable withdrawal. As of June 2021, EPFO has settled more than Rs 76.31 lakhs advance claims for Covid 19 amounting to a whopping Rs. 18698.15 crores.
