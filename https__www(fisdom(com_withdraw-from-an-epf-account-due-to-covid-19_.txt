Given below are a few details relating to such withdrawal from EPF.What is EPF?Employee Provident Fund (EPF) is a decades old retirement benefits scheme introduced by the Government of India. Under this scheme, the employer and the employee contribute a small portion i.e. a percentage of the earnings of the employee towards this fund. This scheme focuses on providing retirement benefits to the members of the fund in the form of a corpus fund. Investment in EPF also provides tax benefits to employees with respect to the contribution made, interest earned and the fund withdrawn at maturity. When is withdrawal from EPF permissible?Under the normal rules of EPF, withdrawal from EPF is permissible subject to certain conditions. Members can opt for partial or full withdrawal from the fund provided they meet the underlying conditions specified in this regard. The amount of withdrawal and the number of years after which withdrawal is possible depends on the purpose of withdrawal.The fund also provides relief in the form of withdrawal when a disaster or a pandemic has been declared by the Government. As the Covid 19 situation has been declared a pandemic, the members of the EPF are allowed an emergency withdrawal from the fund. Such withdrawal is considered to be a non-refundable withdrawal. As of June 2021, EPFO has settled more than Rs 76.31 lakhs advance claims for Covid 19 amounting to a whopping Rs. 18698.15 crores. The government has assured that Covid 19 related claims will be taken on priority and will be settled within a period of 3 days from making the claim.  Explore Investments of Your Choice @ Fisdom!Who can withdraw from EPF due to Covid 19 pandemic?Any member of EPF Scheme, 1952 having a UAN (Universal Account Number) and employed in any establishment or factory that is covered under EPF & MP Act, 1952 is eligible for the withdrawal from EPF due to Covid 19 pandemic. Withdrawal from EPF due to Covid 19 was first declared in March 2020 as part of the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana.

The process for the same is explained below.Offline procedure for withdrawalThe offline procedure requires the members to submit the New Composite claim form (Aadhaar) or New Composite claim form (Non-Aadhaar) depending on whether their Aadhaar is linked with the UAN or not. The form has to be submitted to the Jurisdictional EPFO’s Office after self-certifying the Form.It is to be noted that the New Composite claim form (Non-Aadhaar) also requires the employer’s attestation.The supporting documents to be submitted along with the form are a PAN card and a cancelled cheque. Online procedure for withdrawal The steps for making an online application for withdrawal are mentioned below.Login to the EPFO Website using the UAN (Universal Account Number)Choose the option Claim (Form-31, 19, and 10C) from the ‘Online services’ tabAfter making the above selection, the next page will display the details of the member and will require them to enter the last 4 digits of their bank account number.The member can click on ‘Proceed for online claim’ after verifying the details provided.The next step is to apply for ‘PF Advance (Form 31)’In the tab purpose of outbreak, the member will have to input ‘Outbreak of Pandemic (Covid 19)’The member will be required to mention the amount of advance that is to be withdrawn and provide the necessary details like address and scanned copy of the cancelled cheque.In the next step, the member will need to provide the Aadhaar OTP for verification.After entering the OTP received on the registered mobile number, the member will have to click on ‘Submit’ to complete the application process for claim. Is this withdrawal taxable?The amount withdrawn from EPF is tax-free at the hands of the members.

The amount required to withdraw as a relief measure against the pandemic is provided as aid to the members to ease their financial stress. A levy of tax on such an amount will defeat the purpose of relief and hence the question of taxation, in this case, does not arise. ConclusionEPF is an essential investment for the working class of the country.
