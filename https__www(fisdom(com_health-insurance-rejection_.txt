We saw individuals getting discharged from hospitals with bills running in lakhs during the 1st wave. This prompted many to go in for covers – especially Corona Kavach and Corona Rakshak.But many who had health covers are ending up with claim rejections or paying a majority portion from their pockets. Why are the health insurance claims getting rejected? The Corona Kavach and Corona Rakshak were specific covers introduced last year during the first wave due to the low health insurance penetration in India. Insurance penetration in India stands at 0.94% (insurance premium to GDP%) for the non-life insurance segment against a global average of 3.88%. As these covers were disease-specific covers, they were priced low. Remember, we are dealing with a pandemic here. So with the second wave, the number of claims has exploded.As of 14 May,There were 14.82 lakh customers who had submitted claims to the tune of Rs 22,955 crores. Each claim amounted to Rs 1.5L on average while the amount being settled amounted to Rs 95k – almost 1/3rd of the claim amount was paid by the insured. Undoubtedly, the insurers are being inundated with claims which are affecting their balance sheets. So they are taking a foot back in clearing the claims.

So, it is advisable to have a small portion of your portfolio invested in gold. It could be done easily through gold mutual funds as it is safe and cuts storage costs. Gains made from the redemption of gold mutual funds are taxed under two different categories based on the holding period.      ?If the gold fund is held for under three years, the gains are categorised as short-term capital gains and taxed at your Income Tax slab.     ?If the holding period is more than three years, you get indexation benefit, and gains are taxed at 20%.
