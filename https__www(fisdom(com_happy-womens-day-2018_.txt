Written by: Parul Mehta (A happy customer of fisdom)  Rise Higher  As a child, I would watch beautiful birds; Admire their strength and courage beyond words. I loved that the birds could fly so high; I had no wings and I wondered why.I dreamt of having my own wings some day; Open them up and fly away. I asked my dad if it was possible for me; He said now that I wanted, it will surely be.“Like birds have wings to fly; you too have your self-belief to rely on. Go create your own wings, and experience the joy it brings. Knowledge will bring wisdom and wisdom will empower; That my child will give you wings like no other”.Next, I asked, how would I know if my wings had grown? “The day you feel free, they will shine on their own. Have faith in yourself and the job will be half done; I promise you, my child, you will be second to none.”Having embarked on that journey; I met some lows on the way, Some withered away my confidence; And some just made me sway.My self-belief would always say in my dips, “Chin up princess, else the crown slips” No one except you can pull you down; Bring back that smile and wear it as your crown.Both victory and defeat, you better embrace, No matter what, live life with grace. Fly, run or walk at your pace, Always live your life with grace.”There may be times when hard will get harder; The glory of the past may be shaken altogether. There may be times when you feel you may drown; And that exactly is the time, to rise even higher.These lovely lessons still thrive in my heart; Every day I make a promise that no matter what, I will give more power to my wings; If I want to play my music, only I must tighten the stringsJoin our Fin Insight Community  Financial Planning  AI tools for personal finance advice- can you rely on them? 22 May  8 minutes   Financial Planning  Portfolio Rebalancing – What is it?
