These incomes are usually mentioned under the provisions of section 10 of the Act and its subsections. Such exemptions are provided to grant relief from taxation to the taxpayers belonging to key sectors of the economy or to help economically backward sections or boost the economic activities in a particular area or industry. An exemption can be provided on the total income of the taxpayer or on a partial income as per the relevant provisions of the Act depending on the nature of the income. Why is it important to file exempt income in ITR?Many taxpayers believe that exempt income need not be filed under the Income Tax laws. However, that is not the case. The department insists that taxpayers duly file the relevant ITRs in either of the following class,If the taxpayer is out of the ambit of taxation on account of their income being up to the basic exemption limit as per the applicable tax laws, or,If their income is exempt under any provisions of the Act. This helps the Department get clarity on the exempt income and the source of such income even if there is no tax revenue generated on the same. Some of the key reasons why filing exempt income in the ITR is important are discussed below. Transparency The prime reason for filing exempt income even if they are not taxable is the need for transparency of all the sources of income. The provisions of the Income Tax Act, 1961, mandate the assessee to declare all their sources of income irrespective of their taxability. This will further help them escape any penal provisions in the future relating to any accusations of undisclosed income and avoid any future hassles.  Clarity of intention of taxpayers The intention of the taxpayer will not be questioned at any point if they have duly disclosed their exempt income in the relevant ITRs. There will be no possibilities or accusations of mens rea by the Department, which will further ease the burden on both parties.  Completion of the ITR As the provisions of the Income Tax Act, 1961 requires the assessee to provide all the sources of their income in the ITR, non-compliance with the same will deem the returns filed incomplete. The consequences of filing an incomplete ITR are severe and the assessee may also be liable to pay a penalty for the same. Therefore, it is important to file exempt income in the ITR even if the tax liability is nil.  Curbing any possibility of black money Non-filing of exempt income may lead to hoarding of assets and may also lead to the accumulation of black money. The perils of black money in the economy are multifaceted and have been faced since the time of independence. Hence, to curb any possibility of creating wealth through black money, and concentration of power in the hands of a few, the department insists that the taxpayers file even their exempt income in the relevant ITRs on the respective due dates for the same. What are some of the common exempt incomes as per the Income Tax Act,1961?The list of exempt income as per the Income Tax Act is quite extensive. Some of the common exemptions that are often availed by the taxpayers are listed below. Section Description 10(1)Income from agriculture and allied activities. 10(2)An amount received by a person through HUF10(2A)Income received by partners through a firm10(10)Gratuity income10(10B)Compensation to victims of Bhopal Gas Leak Disaster Act 198510(10BC)Compensation obtained by victims in the event of a disaster10(10D)LIC Policy Receipts10(13A)House Rent Allowance10(5) Leave travel Concession10(43)Reverse Mortgage10(13)Amount received from a superannuation fund 10(18)Amount received as a family pension or pension of gallantry-award recipients10(37)Capital gains from the transfer of agricultural landConclusionExempt income is essentially the non-taxable income that is outside the purview of taxation as per the Income Tax Act, 1961. This income may be exempt but has to be included in the ITR to ensure the completion of the return. This will ensure that the income is duly disclosed and accounted for in the Income tax records. FAQsIs every exempt income 100% exempt?The exempt income can be fully exempt (100% exempt) or partially exempt depending on the nature of the income.What is the difference between exempt income and deduction from income?Exempt income is income that is not taxable and therefore is not included in the Gross taxable income.
