However, the fund does not guarantee the achievement of the objectives and generation of returns. Reasons to invest in the NFOThis fund belongs to the mid-cap fund category and provides the benefits of diversified investment classes. The key benefits of investing in this fund are highlighted below. Diversified and balanced portfolio The assets of the fund will majorly belong to the mid-cap companies segment, i.e, a minimum of 65%. The other investment classes include strategic investments in small-cap stocks as well as large-cap stocks for liquidity. The investment strategy of the fund is to create a balanced portfolio that is a healthy mix of pro-cyclical and counter-cyclical stocks to reduce the impact of microeconomic shocks.An excellent option for long-term investment Investment in mid-cap funds is a riskier option as these stocks are more volatile than large-cap stocks, however, in the long term, these stocks have the potential to provide better returns than the large cap as well as debt funds category. Hence, investors who have a higher risk appetite and a longer investment horizon can opt for this NFO.Expert team White Oak Capital has an excellent team of experts that cover more than 1000 stocks which account for more than Rs.1,00 crore in market capitalization. The fund manager and their team for this fund track every target sector with in-depth analysis. These analysts have experience in tracking these sectors for more than a decade and have, therefore, gained expertise in analyzing the sectoral behaviour to the changing trends and market conditions. Detailed analysis of the negative list of stocksThe fund undertakes detailed forensic analysis to identify stocks that can belong to the negative stock lists. This will help in reducing the possibility of accidents on account of inadequate corporate governance. Performance of the benchmarkGiven below is a brief outlook of the returns of the S&P BSE Midcap 150 TRI index against other indices over various periods as on 8th August 2022.PeriodS&P BSE Midcap 150 TRINifty Midcap 150 TRINifty Midcap 100 TRI1-Year6.76%9.6%9.67%3-Year28.66%27.88%26.27%5-Year14.1%14.23%11.61%Since Inception17.64%16.56%20.74%Risk of investment in White Oak Capital Mid Cap FundSome of the prime risk of investing in this fund are mentioned hereunder.High-risk fund This fund belongs to the high-risk category.

Hence, investors who may prefer short-term gains may not find it a lucrative or attractive investment option.  Fund detailsScheme nameWhite Oak Capital Mid Cap Fund Type of SchemeAn open-ended equity scheme with majority investments in the mid-cap companiesCategory of the schemeMid Cap FundBenchmarkS&P BSE Midcap 150 TRIPlan and optionsPlans – Regular Plan and Direct PlanOptions – Growth option and IDCW (Pay-out and reinvestment option)Fund ManagerMr. Ramesh Mantri (Equity), Mr. Piyush Baranwal (Debt), and Ms. Trupti Agrawal (Overseas Investments)Exit Load1% of NAV if redeemed within 30 days of investment (NIL after 30 days)Minimum InvestmentLumpsum Mode – Minimum Rs. 500 and in multiples of Re. 1/- thereafter and minimum Rs. 500 (in multiples of Re. 1/- thereafter) for additional application SIP Mode – Minimum Rs. 500 NFO Period16th August 2022 – 30th August 2022How to invest in White Oak Capital Mid Cap Fund?Investors can invest in this fund through the Fisdom app by using the following link.FAQs1. What is NFO? NFO (New Fund Offer) is launched by the Asset Management Companies (AMCs) to generate funds for launching a new mutual fund. These funds are then pooled to buy the shares or other securities as per the fund’s mandate or the guidelines based on which the fund is launched. NFOs are like IPOs where all the relevant details of the funds are provided at the time of their launch and the units of the fund are usually set at Rs. 10 per unit for a subscription. SEBI guidelines allow the NFOs to be active for a maximum period of 30 days following which the units of the fund are traded based on their daily NAV.2. What are the types of NFOs?NFOs, at the time of their launch, are launched in two categories namely close-ended funds and open-ended funds. The details of each type of fund are mentioned below.Open-ended fundsThe majority of mutual funds are launched as open-ended funds. Investors can subscribe to the fund at the nominal rate (usually Rs. 10 per unit) during the NFO period. After the NFO period, when the units are traded based on the daily NAV, the investors stand to gain huge capital gains depending on the performance of the fund.Close-ended fundsClose-ended funds, on the other hand, do not allow the investors to subscribe to the fund after the NFO period is closed. 3. What are the points to consider before investing in NFOs?Investing in NFOs is a very good opportunity to maximize the returns as the units can be subscribed at nominal rates and the returns are potentially higher based on the prevailing NAV at the time of redemption. However, there are several points that need to be considered while subscribing to an NFO. Some of such points are highlighted below. a)Track record of the AMCNFOs are offered for the new mutual fund so no proven track record can be reviewed by investors to make an informed investment decision. The investors have to therefore rely on the reputation of the AMC and other details mentioned in the NFO to make an investment decision. b)Expense ratio (if mentioned)NFOs need a good amount of publicity to make the investors aware of the fund and the investment opportunity. It is therefore essential for the investors to check the expense ratio of the fund and ensure that it does not outweigh the net gains. c)Check if the fund is in correlation to the existing portfolioRecently there have been many NFOs in the market that investors can choose from. However, while selecting the fund the investors must check if the fund is not similar to an existing fund in their portfolio. For example, if the fund is a large-cap fund and the investor already has one or two similar funds in their portfolio, investing in another will not add much value to the net returns or the diversification of the portfolio. On the other hand, many NFOs can be sector-specific or country-specific. In such a case, investors have to check if the fund is in line with other factors like their risk-return profile and investment goals. d)Review the SID carefullyReviewing the SID (Scheme Information Document) is a crucial step that should not be missed by investors while investing in NFOs. It contains all the relevant information about the fund managers, their qualifications, and experience which is crucial for the funds’ performance. Other relevant information includes the investment profile of the fund, target sectors or securities, benchmark index, asset allocation ratio, etc. This helps the investors understand the returns expectation of the fund as well as the target investments where the fund will invest the pooled funds. Investors having a risk-return profile in line with that of the fund can thus invest in such funds. 4. How to invest in NFOs? Investment in NFOs can be done through two main routes i.e., the online or offline modes. The details of the same are mentioned below.a)Online modeThe online mode of investment is suitable for investors already having a Demat account and a trading account. Investors can simply select the NFO and invest by selecting the number of units to invest and paying for the same through online payment modes available on the platform.  b)Offline modeThe offline mode of investment in NFOs is through registered brokers and distributors. Investors can contact their brokers and distributors providing them with the details of the amount to be invested and they can invest in the selected NFOs on their behalf. Investors can make hassle-free investments through such modes as all the necessary forms to be filled and the formalities to be met are looked after by these entities giving investors the benefit of ease of investment. The charges for such services are nominal when compared to the potentially high returns.   New Fund Offers(NFO)  ICICI Pru Innovation Fund NFO 12 Apr  5 minutes   New Fund Offers(NFO)  TAX SAVER FUND White Oak  NFO – 2023 09 Jan  9 minutes   New Fund Offers(NFO)  [Updated[ ICICI Pru Tpt & Logistics Fund -202 01 Dec  9 minutes   New Fund Offers(NFO)  HDFC Business Cycle NFO Review 22 Nov  8 minutes   New Fund Offers(NFO)  Baroda BNP Multi Asset NFO Review 22 Nov  8 minutes   New Fund Offers(NFO)  IDFC Tpt & Logistics Fund 06 Oct  10 minutes   New Fund Offers(NFO)  Union Retirement Fund NFO Review 15 Sep  8 minutes   New Fund Offers(NFO)  Kotak Business Cycles Fund NFO 15 Sep  7 minutes   New Fund Offers(NFO)  IDFC Nifty100 Low Volatility 30 Index Fund 15 Sep  7 minutes   New Fund Offers(NFO)  ICICI Prudential Nifty50 Equal Weight Index Fund NFO 15 Sep  7 minutes   New Fund Offers(NFO)  Edelweiss Gold & Silver ETF FOF NFO 02 Sep  7 minutes   New Fund Offers(NFO)  ICICI Pru PSU Equity Fund NFO 02 Sep  7 minutes
