If an applicant rarely travels internationally, then it may not be sensible to get a premium travel credit card. The card selected should be such that one can make the most of it as per spending patterns without having to pay hefty annual fees.Recommended read – 6 top tips to improve your credit score2.Individual financial needs Asking yourself why you need a credit card is another critical aspect to consider. Is the card required to build a credit score? If yes, then getting a zero annual fee credit card may make sense. Is it needed to transfer the outstanding balance on existing credit cards? Then a credit card with the lowest interest rate is a better option.3.Do your research While exploring all the credit card options available, try to conduct some basic research on credit cards of choice. While you don’t have to go through every credit card site, you can search for the right credit card and review/compare a few that may fit the bill.4.Specific category benefits If you go for a category-specific card, for example, a travel credit card, select the one that offers extra benefits on it. For instance, certain credit cards come with emergency overseas hospitalisation cover, air accident insurance, etc, apart from the usual benefits.ConclusionThere are numerous credit cards available in India. Thus, it is up to you to select the right credit card wisely. Be clear about your needs, do some research and then select the right card and understand all terms around a credit card like the minimum amount due, credit limit, etc .

Judicious users can make the most of credit card benefits in India without falling into a debt trap.Do I have to pay if I don’t use my credit card?Depending on the specific terms of usage of a credit card, you may have to pay annual fees even if you do not use the card. However, this differs across credit card categories.
