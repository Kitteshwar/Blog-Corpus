Taxpayers usually account for their primary source of income while filing the returns but the income from other sources is usually missed. These incomes usually include passive income sources like interest income or dividend or rent income, especially in the case of senior citizens. The government in a bid to reduce the cases of tax evasion has levied TDS provisions on such income. However, in the majority of cases, these incomes form a very minute part of their total income and taxpayers have the unnecessary burden of waiting for a refund of the same.   Table of Contents  hide   1 What are Form 15G and Form 15H?   2 Who is eligible to submit Form 15G and Form 15H?   3 Cases for which Form 15G and Form 15H can be submitted?   4 Conclusion   5 FAQs   6 Other interesting reads Form 15G and Form 15H are solutions to these issues where taxpayers can avoid the deduction of TDS on such income.

This form can be submitted by taxpayers who are below the age of 60 years. Form 15H, on the other hand, can be filed by taxpayers who are above the age of 60 years (senior citizens). By submitting these forms, the banks and other financial institutions understand that they are not mandated to deduct TDS under the Income Tax Act and its provisions relating to TDS. This form is to be provided at the beginning of the year so as to provide the banks with timely information about the TDS applicability on the taxpayers’ accounts. Who is eligible to submit Form 15G and Form 15H?The Income Tax Act has laid down specific eligibility criteria for taxpayers who can submit Form 15G and Form 15H.
