These funds invest predominantly in debt and debt-related instruments (like corporate bonds or government bonds) or money market instruments that have a maturity of 7 years and more. These funds have relatively lower risk as compared to equity funds or equity-oriented hybrid funds. However, the risk is relatively higher than the short term debt funds due to the interest rate fluctuations on account of long duration. Who are the target investors for long duration funds?Investment in long duration funds is ideal for investors with a long term investment horizon. The risk of investing in long duration funds is higher as compared to short duration funds but the return potential is quite higher.

Some of the basic disadvantages of long duration funds are mentioned below.a. Interest rate riskInterest rate risk is the risk of fluctuations in the interest rate and is quite higher in long duration funds. These funds invest a majority of their corpus in corporate bonds or government bonds as well as money market instruments which have a long duration of 7 years or more. This extended duration invites a major impact on the fund due to rising interest rates and a fall in bond prices. b. Credit riskThe credit risk in any fund is the risk of default by the bond issuer at the time of maturity of the underlying assets of the fund. The longer duration of these funds increases the credit risk as the risk of default or downgrade of the underlying bond increases with the extended duration.  How are long duration funds taxed?The taxation of long duration funds is similar to any other debt fund.
