Crude oil (WTI) prices surged on the hopes of an improvement in demand due to COVID-19 vaccinations.Declining crude oil inventories in U.S., tighter supplies from OPEC, and rising govt. taxes, further supported oil prices to reach its pre-pandemic level, adding to inflation level.As pressures on perishable food prices ready for a go on the downside, other factors such as supply-side disruptions, and higher labor charges can dampen hopes of drop in inflation in coming times.
