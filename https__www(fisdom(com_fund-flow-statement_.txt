However, it fails to provide any details of its particulars. For instance, it says the fixed assets of the organisation are to the tune of 850, but it does not provide any information if the said assets are newly purchased or have been in the organisation for long.This is where a Funds-Flow Statement comes into picture.

It shows the inflow and outflow of the funds over a period of time which is essentially between 2 balance sheets.Let us consider the following two balance sheets, revealing the position of an organisation in the previous year and the current year:31st March 2020Liabilities31st March 202131st March 2020Assets31st March 2021300Share Capital500700Fixed Assets850175Reserves300   400Long term loans300   200Current Liabilities250375Current Assets5001075 13501075 1350Let us examine each figure on the liabilities and the assets side in order to determine if there has been an inflow or outflow of funds.Uses of Fund Flow Statement Share Capital The very first item on the liabilities side indicates an increase in the owner’s funds, i.e., the Share Capital.

This reflects the retained profits of the organisation which is another source of funds and will appear on the sources side of the Funds-Flow Statement.

Fixed Assets The first item on the Assets side of the Balance Sheet shows an increase in the value of the fixed assets. This indicates a fresh purchase of an asset in the current year and thus will be reflected in the uses side of the Funds-Flow Statement. Current Assets and Current Liabilities The remaining items on the Balance sheet namely the Current Assets and the Current Liabilities have to be looked at together to get a clear picture regarding the working capital of the organisation.
