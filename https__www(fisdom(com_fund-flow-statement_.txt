Hence, a fund flow statement is crucial from an organization point of view as well as from the investor point of view. Read on to know all about a Fund Flow statement.

However, it fails to provide any details of its particulars. For instance, it says the fixed assets of the organisation are to the tune of 850, but it does not provide any information if the said assets are newly purchased or have been in the organisation for long.This is where a Funds-Flow Statement comes into picture. A balance sheet reflects the position of an organisation as on a day (be it the last day of the financial year or an interim period). A fund flow statement on the other hand is over a period of time. It shows the inflow and outflow of the funds over a period of time which is essentially between 2 balance sheets.Let us consider the following two balance sheets, revealing the position of an organisation in the previous year and the current year:31st March 2020Liabilities31st March 202131st March 2020Assets31st March 2021300Share Capital500700Fixed Assets850175Reserves300   400Long term loans300   200Current Liabilities250375Current Assets5001075 13501075 1350Let us examine each figure on the liabilities and the assets side in order to determine if there has been an inflow or outflow of funds.Uses of Fund Flow Statement Share Capital The very first item on the liabilities side indicates an increase in the owner’s funds, i.e., the Share Capital. An increase in the Share Capital can only be in the case of a fresh issue of shares which here is to the tune of 200. This is a source of the funds for the organisation hence will appear on the sources side of the Funds-Flow Statement. Reserves and Surplus Next comes the Reserves and Surplus also having an increase of 125 between the two balance sheet dates. This reflects the retained profits of the organisation which is another source of funds and will appear on the sources side of the Funds-Flow Statement. Long Term Loans Moving on, the third item on the Balance Sheet is the Long Term Loans. It shows a decrease in the amount by 100 which can be on account of repayment. This indicates a use of the available funds and hence will be reflected on the uses side of the Statement. Fixed Assets The first item on the Assets side of the Balance Sheet shows an increase in the value of the fixed assets. This indicates a fresh purchase of an asset in the current year and thus will be reflected in the uses side of the Funds-Flow Statement. Current Assets and Current Liabilities The remaining items on the Balance sheet namely the Current Assets and the Current Liabilities have to be looked at together to get a clear picture regarding the working capital of the organisation. The changes in the working capital also indicate an allocation of the funds available and therefore, a typical Funds-Flow Statement also includes a Statement Showing Change in Working Capital.STATEMENT SHOWING CHANGE IN WORKING CAPITALParticulars31st March 202031st March 2021Current Assets375500(-) Current Liabilities200250Net Working Capitals175250Increase in Working Capitals 75The increase in the working capital by 75 shows that the organisation has allocated more money in the working capital and hence this will reflect on the uses side of the Funds-Flow Statement.Let us now prepare a Funds-Flow Statement for this organisation based on the information derived from the above two Balance Sheets.FUNDS-FLOW STATEMENTSourcesRs.UsesRs.Fresh Issue of Shares200Repayment of loans100Retained Earnings125Purchase of Fixed Assets150  Increase in Working Capital75 325 325The above statement indicates that while the closing balances of the two years may be 1075 and 1350, the actual flow of funds during the period is to the tune of 325.The said inflow of 325 is on account of a fresh issue of shares and through retained earnings. However, the same is not reflected as a direct increase in the cash or bank balance of the entity. The uses side of the Statement indicates the areas of allocation of the said funds raised.This enables the management to track all the funds that have come in and gone out of the organisation.Another key feature of a financial statement of any organisation is the Cash Flow Statement. It focuses on the actual inflow and outflow of cash from the organisation. It is mainly used to determine the liquidity position of the organisation and thus identify any liquidity problems, if any.A Funds-Flow Statement on the other hand deals with the long-term nature of the funds, its application as well as the position of the working capital and its impact on the organisation. This further determines the financial situation of the entity and enables a correct allocation of its funds. It is a crucial factor leading to healthy financial planning.How do fund flow analysis help investors?The fund flow analysis is a great help for potential investors in deciding whether the company can manage the funds properly or not.
