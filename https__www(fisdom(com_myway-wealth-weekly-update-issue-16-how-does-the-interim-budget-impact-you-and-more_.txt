They want a lot of government expenditure, but they don’t want higher taxes.— Bruce RaunerThe interim budget 2019 invited quite a euphoria in the parliament as the NDA-led government presented a bouquet of sops to almost every section of the society – the farmers, military, MSMEs, film-makers and yes, the middle-class of India.The budget was no less than a classic election budget where expenses were read out with compassion and doubts on sources of revenue were brushed under the carpet. But, that’s the beauty of democracy – the larger public of the economy does not understand public economics.The comprehensive highlights are already doing rounds in the press and social media, but here I would like to present the top five highlights that would probably matter the most – at least from a personal finance perspective.Interim Budget 2019 HighlightHow does it impact you?Increased standard deductionYou can claim an additional INR 10,000 as a deduction from your incomeIncreased income tax rebateIndians earning up to INR 5 Lakh do not need to pay income tax; utilizing 80C investment limits – INR 6.5 Lakh p.a. becomes non-taxableTDS limit hiked – post-office savings schemeNo TDS till interest earned on post office savings exceed INR 40,000 p.a. (previous INR 10,000)Scope for tax exemption on notional rent expandedYou can now own a second home without paying tax on notional rentIncrease in gratuity limitGratuity can be earned up to INR 20 Lakh (previous: INR 10 Lakh)Most expected an increase in the section 80C limit and/or a roll-back of the LTCG tax on equities introduced in the previous budget. However, expecting the government to cut taxes mostly paid by the rich – especially during the election season was too wishful at best.While there was no relief specifically for equity investors, the week has seen quite a run-up – especially as it approached the interim budget day.While the interim budget made the day a tad bit exciting, the announcements should be taken with a pinch of salt. At least till the post-election full budget continues the line of thought.If you have any concern, please write to us at ask@fisdom.com or call at +918048039999, we would be happy to answer your query.Share the article                      Get exclusive content
