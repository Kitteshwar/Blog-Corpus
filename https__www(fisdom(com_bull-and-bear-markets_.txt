These actions are used as metaphors for stock market movements.

Here are some of the indications of an upcoming or ongoing bear market:1. High unemployment rateHigh unemployment rates are seen as a sign of an upcoming or ongoing bear market.

Economic problems can come up and even go away depending on the stock market resilience and how investors react to it. In a bear market, investors can benefit by adjusting their investment portfolio to focus more on safer investment avenues, such as fixed-income investments. Since no one can tell when a bear market situation will end, such instruments can benefit the investor by allowing stable returns from investment.How can an investor predict a bull or bear market?Predicting a bull or a bear market may be difficult, but not impossible. As the sayings go ‘History repeats itself’ and ‘what goes up must come down’, if the current market sees share prices rising, an investor must know that these might fall in the future, resulting in a correction or a future bear market. If stock prices are falling in the current market, an investor can be confident that these will rise again and a bull market will arise.While an investor cannot exactly predict when a bull or a bear market will arise, certain factors can affect current market situations and drive changes. An unexpected international crisis tends to create a bearish market since the economies are negatively affected, an apt example for this being the onset of the pandemic. If there is negative news about a company’s market capitalization, it affects the market and results in a bearish market. Positive news about a large-scale company can create a bullish market.A bull market is also seen when a country wages war, since it may produce additional jobs and the investors begin to feel confident about its win.ConclusionA bullish market is when the overall demand for stocks is higher than their supply, resulting in higher share prices. A bearish market arises when the supply is higher than the demand and results in a significant drop in share prices.Investors must preferably buy more shares in a bearish market, since the shares are usually available for lower prices. They can then sell their shares during a bullish market since more people will be willing to buy during this time and can therefore book profits by getting higher prices.FAQsIs it smart to invest in a bear market?Although bear markets tend to be scary for investors, stock market performances have proven that they will bounce back, eventually.
