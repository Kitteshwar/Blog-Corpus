FisdomResearchWritten by - Fisdom ResearchOctober 8, 2022  5 minutes  —————————————————————————————————————————————–Story OutlineCCI approved the proposed merger of ZEE, and Sony picturesSPNI (Sony) shareholders will hold a 50.86 per cent stake in the merged entity.Punit Goenka, the CEO of ZEE, will lead the merged entity.Both companies have a complimentary forte, and synergies are lucrative.Zee Entertainment Enterprises’ share price rallied by ~10 per cent during the week after the Competition Commission of India approved the proposed merger with Sony. With this, there will be only one final check from shareholders to approve the merger in the shareholder meeting scheduled on October 14th.Below is the stock performance of ZEE so far post the merger announcement:What circumstances led to the merger?Zee Entertainment is inter-alia engaged in TV content development, broadcasting regional and international entertainment on satellite television channels, movies, music, and digital business. The Company is among India’s most extensive entertainment networks.Sony is engaged in creating, owning, operating, programming, providing, transmitting, distributing, and promoting linear and non-linear, non-news program services, including sports program services, delivered by any means primarily to viewers in India and the Indian diaspora globally. They are also involved in the production, exhibition, broadcast, rebroadcast, transmission, re-transmission or other exploitation of non-news audio-visual content, including sports content, in any format or language spoken in India (including English) for exploitation of such program services.Until 2017, the Sony Network had the broadcast rights to the country’s marquee cricket tournament Indian Premier League. From FY15 to FY18, Sony’s revenue almost doubled from ~Rs. 3,300 crores to ~Rs. 6,300 crores and the net profit jumped by six times. But as Star & Disney India took over the IPL broadcasting rights in September 2017, Sony’s revenues stagnated while impacting the net profit negatively.ZEE had struggled with its continuous decline in promoter stake. It has declined from 43.05 per cent in December 2015 to 3.99 per cent.The Deal SynergiesWith combined revenues of both entities at $1.79 bn, the merged entity would be the second largest entertainment network after Disney & Star India, with an approximate revenue of $1.8 bn. Another critical factor is that the merged entity will have 75 channels and a strong presence in sports, entertainment and regional markets.Below is a summary of synergies for both companies:GenreZee EntertainmentSony Pictures Networks IndiaTotalHindi GEC6511Hindi Movies9413Sports–1010Regional25227English9413Kids–11Total number of channels492675Overall all India market share17%10%–OTT PlatformsZEE5SonyLIV–The merged entity allows both players to fill in white spaces in their respective segments.Sony has a negligible presence in regional channels, whereas ZEE has impressive organic growth in the Bengali, Marathi, or South Indian language space. Similarly, ZEE Entertainment Enterprises has zero presence in the sports segment, especially in the cricket segment. The combination will help ZEE-Sony to emerge as a dominant player in Hindi, GEC, Hindi Movie English entertainment and Marathi genres.Within the film content space, the merger will help synergies quite neatly. ZEE has aggressively invested in films in its OTT, TV and music business. At the same time, Sony has not been aggressive in producing regional language films but has a robust suite of international movies that can be distributed in India.Below is the structure of the organisation pre and post-merger.Way Forward: As per Punit Goenka, MD & CEO of ZEE Entertainment Enterprises, the merger will bring in 6-8% synergies in cost reduction. With the $1.57 bn cash coming into the company, this could mean the further scope of M&A opportunities within the digital space and help in premium bidding for content like sports.The merged entity is set to capture a significant foothold and receive strong ad spending from industries as it would have a much broader reach. The merged entity would also have a competent and experienced board that knows the business well. We think that the deal is a win-win situation for shareholders, minority shareholders, and promoters.Markets This Week 03rd October 2022 (Open)07th October 2022 (Close)%ChangeNifty 5017,10217,3151.24%Sensex57,40458,1911.37%Markets ended the week on a positive note.During the week the INR touched a fresh low of 82.42.On the BSE, the Metal index rose 5.7 percent, BSE Capital Goods index is up 3.6 percent & Realty index gained 3.4 percent.
