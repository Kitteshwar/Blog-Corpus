Reviewing these hard data and given its more than 100-year-old existence, it can be safely said that TMB Bank has established itself as a trustworthy name among the masses. Also, the TMB IPO is priced at approximately 1.4 times higher than its book value in FY 22 (based on fully diluted post-issue equity). All these factors make it an overall attractive investment option for investors looking for long-term investments. However, investors looking for listing gains may be disappointed as the grey market premium was approximately 10% which had eventually come down to Rs. 7 by end of the trading day on 5th September 2022.How to invest in TMB IPO?Investors can invest in this IPO through the Fisdom app.Related LinksThe Signal (weekly highlights)Macroscope – Indian Industrial Production (IIP) Reading Of IIP Index For The Month September 2020The Signal (weekly highlights)AUM (Assets under Management) –  Impact on types of mutual funds & expense ratioInitial Public Offer (IPO) – What is it, Purpose, Advantages of IPO, FAQS  Stock Markets  Large Cap Stocks – What is it, Features & Factors to be Considered 08 Jun  9 minutes   Stock Markets  Beta in Indian stocks – Types, Should you invest in high beta stocks? 07 Jun  8 minutes   Stock Markets  Top SIX Online Stock Market Courses in India-2023 05 Jun  8 minutes   FeaturedStock Markets  IKIO Lighting Limited IPO – Price, Lot size, Open date, GMP & Review 05 Jun  6 minutes   Stock Markets  Types of Earnings Per Share(EPS) – Calculation & How to Use Them  01 Jun  10 minutes   FeaturedStock Markets  Top Traders in India 31 May  9 minutes   Stock Markets  What are monopoly stocks?
