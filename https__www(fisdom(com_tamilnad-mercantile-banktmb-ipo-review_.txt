This makes it an attractive buying option for investors.The ROCE (Return on Capital Employed) of TMB is again higher at 16.58% compared to the industry average of 8.30%Finally, the RoNW (Return in Net worth) of TMB is 15.40% which is the next best in the industry after CSB Bank which has a RoNW of 17.29%These parameters further showcase the relatively better position of TMB and its fast track for growth. Risks of investmentThe key risk of investment in this IPO is mentioned hereunder. TMB has a significant percentage of its equity, 37.7% of its paid-up share capital, subject to outstanding legal proceedings which are still pending in various legal forums.There is also an ongoing legal proceeding with the Directorate of Enforcement regarding the petition filed by a former Director alleging mismanagement in the bank.The bank could face a negative impact on its business, reputation, and financials if the verdict of these legal proceedings would be adverse for them.The bank also has higher contingent liabilities than its net worth along with a risk of an increase in NPAs which can pose a danger to its financials The prime concentration of the bank is in Tamil Nadu, therefore, any adverse impact in terms of political, economic, or social instability will impact its operations and thereby its financials. The bank requires prior permission from the RBI to open new branches and any hindrance in the same can damage its growth prospects.The bank is heavily reliant on MSME, Retail, and Agricultural Customers for its business, and any negative impact in these segments will have a direct impact on the bank’s bottom line. Should you invest in TMB IPO?The overall performance of TMB has been quite impressive in the past years especially in terms of its core financials, like the increase in deposits by 10.46% CAGR, increase in interests income by 17% CAGR, and decrease in gross NPA from 3.62% to 1.69%. The ROA (Return on Assets ratio)for the bank is also higher at 1.66% compared to the average of 0.80% of its peers. Reviewing these hard data and given its more than 100-year-old existence, it can be safely said that TMB Bank has established itself as a trustworthy name among the masses. Also, the TMB IPO is priced at approximately 1.4 times higher than its book value in FY 22 (based on fully diluted post-issue equity). All these factors make it an overall attractive investment option for investors looking for long-term investments. However, investors looking for listing gains may be disappointed as the grey market premium was approximately 10% which had eventually come down to Rs. 7 by end of the trading day on 5th September 2022.How to invest in TMB IPO?Investors can invest in this IPO through the Fisdom app.Related LinksThe Signal (weekly highlights)Macroscope – Indian Industrial Production (IIP) Reading Of IIP Index For The Month September 2020The Signal (weekly highlights)AUM (Assets under Management) –  Impact on types of mutual funds & expense ratioInitial Public Offer (IPO) – What is it, Purpose, Advantages of IPO, FAQSShare the article                      Get exclusive content
