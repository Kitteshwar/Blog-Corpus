Dalal Street rulesDespite global economic slowdown, rising interest rates and a likely recession in 2023, the Indian stock markets managed to stay strong this year. Defying all odds, the Sensex touched historic highs of 63,583 in December 2022. This goes to show that the Indian markets are in a positive shape and are largely unaffected by global recessionary fears as of now.LIC IPOLIC or Life Insurance Corporation of India went public by launching the country’s largest IPO with an issue size of approximately Rs. 21,000 crores. The issue attracted a record 6.1 million retail applications. However, the stock’s listing was far below investor expectations. Being a cash-rich company, LIC’s long-term standing remains positive, and it continues to attract investor interest.HDFC twins mergeThe country’s biggest housing loan lender HDFC announced the merger between its wholly owned subsidiaries – HDFC Investments Limited and HDFC Holdings Limited. The merger between HDFC and HDFC Bank, which is expected to fructify by April 2023, will create India’s 3rd-largest entity measured by market capitalization. After the merger, the size of the company’s combined balance sheet will be close to Rs. 17.87 lakh crores and a joint net worth of Rs. 3.3 lakh crores. This will make HDFC Bank almost double the size of ICICI Bank. Digital Rupee pilotIn her Budget speech for 2022, FM Sitharaman announced the introduction of Digital Rupee in 2023. Much to the surprise of the nation, the introduction of CBDC has picked pace already with the pilot launch of its retail version on December 1, 2022. CBDC or central bank digital currency is the digital version of India’s fiat currency. It is expected to ease routine financial transactions apart from being a safe and robust alternative to physical currency.Adani grabs a spot on world’s rich listIndian business tycoon and the head of Adani empire, Gautam Adani’s wealth grew leaps and bounds this year. Adani’s net worth stood at $137 billion, mainly driven by his business conglomerate’s rising value. As per the Forbes Rich List of 2022, Adani is behind Tesla’s Elon Musk and LMVH’s Bernard Arnault. Record UPI transactionsIndia’s flagship digital payments platform, Unified Payments Interface (UPI) managed to process a record 7.3 billion transactions by October this year. This was a record-high level since the launch of these services back in 2016. The value of these UPI transactions was estimated to be Rs. 12.11 trillion. This was a 57% jump year-on-year.No other country in the world has such an advanced digital transactions solution on a single platform. Many countries are now looking to emulate India’s UPI success story.Demat accounts shoot upThis year also saw a record number of 18 lakh new Demat accounts being added in the country.This took the total number of Demat accounts in India to 10.6 crores by November 22. On a year-on-year basis, this was a 37% jump, signalling rising investor interest in the stock markets.More Indians are slowly moving away from age-old investment formats like bank fixed deposits to explore avenues like stock markets, mutual funds, etc.Record Rupee depreciationThe Indian Rupee depreciated a record 6.9% against the US Dollar in 2022. The rupee’s fall is mainly attributed to rising crude oil prices due to the Russia-Ukraine war, higher foreign capital outflows, and a strong dollar overseas. The US FED’s frequent interest rate hikes have also driven the Rupee’s depreciation.Adani rules NDTVTo give stiff competition to rival group Reliance, the Adani group acquired NDTV this year through an open offer. Reliance’s media presence is through ownership in Network 18 media company. With the NDTV takeover, Adani will also be able to have a strong media presence.ConclusionIndia’s financial sectors are standing strong despite the global economic slowdown and recessionary fears coming closer.
