It was in line with the market expectations to ensure that inflation remains within the target range.Policy Rates:ParticularsJun-22Aug-22Sep-22Repo rate4.90%5.40%5.90%Standing Deposit Facility (SDF)4.65%5.15%5.65%Marginal Standing Facility (MSF)5.15%5.65%6.15%Bank Rate5.15%5.65%6.15%Five out of six members of the Monetary Policy Committee decided to increase the policy rate by 50 bps to 5.9 per cent. RBI has done a total rate hike of 190 bps since May’22, including the recent rate hike of 50 bps.GDP projections:GDP projectionsJun-22Aug-22Sep-22FY 237.2%7.2%7.0%Q2 FY236.2%6.2%6.3%Q3 FY234.1%4.1%4.6%Q4 FY234.0%4.0%4.6%Q1 FY24–6.7%      7.2%Real GDP for Q1FY23 grew by 13.5 per cent, surpassing robust growth in private consumption and investment demand. The manufacturing sector’s capacity has improved and remained at the highest level in the last three years.However, on the other hand, headwinds from geopolitical tensions, tightening global financial conditions and slowing external demand pose downside risks to net exports and India’s GDP outlook. Merchandise exports have moderated amid headwinds from global uncertainty. As a result, GDP growth projections for FY22-23 were trimmed down to 7 per cent from the earlier 7.2 per cent.We expect GDP growth to take a backseat in Q3FY23 as the base effect goes out of the picture.Inflation projections: CPI InflationJun-22Aug-22Sep-22FY 2022-20236.7%6.7%6.7%Q2 FY237.4%7.1%7.1%Q3 FY236.2%6.4%6.5%Q4 FY235.8%5.8%5.8%Q1 FY24–5.0%5.0%Even though the inflation projections for FY23 remain unchanged, RBI remained vigilant on the uncertainty around inflationary pressures.On faster depletion of forex reserves:India’s foreign exchange reserves have fallen by three trillion rupees from the peak of October 2021; however, RBI has reiterated the resilience of India’s external balances & even currency depreciation compared to peers.The RBI has emphasised that its focus would be on maintaining investor confidence and anchoring expectations signalling further foreign exchange interventions to defend the rupee from any extreme volatility through the forex kitty as it remains strong compared to the 2013 taper tantrum.On banking liquidity deficitLiquidity in the banking system has gone into deficit mode after remaining surplus for almost 40 months. As a result, the call money rates have increased over and above the repo rate. Interbank call money rates had also risen above the repo rate.In the monetary policy meeting, RBI said it would continue undertaking two-way operations to manage liquidity conditions. The RBI has decided to merge the 28-day VRRR auction with the 14-day auction. RBI expects system liquidity to increase as government expenditure picks up on high GST and direct tax collections.We expect liquidity to be in surplus in Q3, supported by RBI’s proposed two-way operations.Investor TakeawaysWhile we remain hopeful that the variables turn in favour, we also acknowledge that the wind is against us. We expect the rate hike cycle to continue for a little longer with quantum depending on the pace at which externalities revert to a range that is at least closer to normal.In light of developments in policy rates and sovereign and corporate bond yields, fixed-income investors can invest in funds with an effective maturity of 3 to 5 years following a roll-down strategy.
