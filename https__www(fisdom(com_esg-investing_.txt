It is a blanket term for investments made in firms that adopt ethical practices to make profits. ESG investors don’t invest in stocks of companies that do not meet some of the environmental, social, or corporate governance standards. For instance, chemical companies causing heavy pollution or companies that have poor labor practices.

The score can range between 0 to 100 and weighs the performance average using the three key factors- Environment, Society and Governance. If the ESG score of a company is high, it indicates good performance through suitable measures around these three factors. A low ESG score is an indication that the company is unable to take appropriate actions on these factors and may undergo losses because of regulatory punishments, environmental crises, etc.How did ESG Investing evolve globally?ESG investing first began in the 1960s when it was called socially responsible investing. It began with investors avoiding stocks or industry investments related to business activities like tobacco production or the South African apartheid regime.Although ESG investing is a nascent concept for Indian investors, there are nearly 3,000 ESG schemes available for investment globally. Many sustainability challenges have been observed for a few years, such as flood risk, the rise of sea levels, privacy threats, data security issues, demographic shifts, regulatory changes, etc. These, in turn, bring in new risk factors for investors. As companies started facing rising complexities on a global scale, investors started reevaluating traditional investment approaches and this gave rise to ESG investing.Businesses across the globe have been focusing on their ESG disclosures for many years now. This has resulted in numerous third-party ESG data and rating providers. How does ESG investing work?ESG investing is quite a unique investing model where investors can select their investments based on the company’s environmental, social, and governance impact. There can be many approaches to ESG investing for retail and institutional investors where investors can look for specific investments that meet their sustainability criteria or exclude companies that may be in the high-risk grade. One of the approaches can be negative screening where investors do not invest in companies that do not meet the ESG parameters. Another approach to ESG investing can be actively scouting for companies specifically or funds that are centered on doing the research and including the prime candidates that meet the ESG parameters.  Reasons for impact investing via ESGESG investing, although a new concept in India, is being accepted fast by investors and is especially seeing an accelerated demand since COVID-19 crisis.
