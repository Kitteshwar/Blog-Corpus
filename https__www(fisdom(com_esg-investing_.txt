They yearn to understand the different aspects that contribute to the stability and continuity of the companies that they invest in. There is greater demand for businesses that survive severe impacts of any crisis and constantly incorporate Environment, Social, and Governance factors within their daily functioning. Here, we will discuss ESG investing in detail and what investors should know about this new-age investment format.What is the meaning of ESG Investing?ESG investing can also be called sustainable investing. It is a blanket term for investments made in firms that adopt ethical practices to make profits. ESG investors don’t invest in stocks of companies that do not meet some of the environmental, social, or corporate governance standards. For instance, chemical companies causing heavy pollution or companies that have poor labor practices. ESG investing has slowly started gaining popularity around the world, as many investment funds have started adopting this model in recent years.Understanding ESG Score – ESG score is a measurement parameter used to estimate the extent of a company’s environmental and socially sustainable actions. The score can range between 0 to 100 and weighs the performance average using the three key factors- Environment, Society and Governance. If the ESG score of a company is high, it indicates good performance through suitable measures around these three factors. A low ESG score is an indication that the company is unable to take appropriate actions on these factors and may undergo losses because of regulatory punishments, environmental crises, etc.How did ESG Investing evolve globally?ESG investing first began in the 1960s when it was called socially responsible investing. It began with investors avoiding stocks or industry investments related to business activities like tobacco production or the South African apartheid regime.Although ESG investing is a nascent concept for Indian investors, there are nearly 3,000 ESG schemes available for investment globally. Many sustainability challenges have been observed for a few years, such as flood risk, the rise of sea levels, privacy threats, data security issues, demographic shifts, regulatory changes, etc. These, in turn, bring in new risk factors for investors. As companies started facing rising complexities on a global scale, investors started reevaluating traditional investment approaches and this gave rise to ESG investing.Businesses across the globe have been focusing on their ESG disclosures for many years now. This has resulted in numerous third-party ESG data and rating providers. How does ESG investing work?ESG investing is quite a unique investing model where investors can select their investments based on the company’s environmental, social, and governance impact. There can be many approaches to ESG investing for retail and institutional investors where investors can look for specific investments that meet their sustainability criteria or exclude companies that may be in the high-risk grade. One of the approaches can be negative screening where investors do not invest in companies that do not meet the ESG parameters. Another approach to ESG investing can be actively scouting for companies specifically or funds that are centered on doing the research and including the prime candidates that meet the ESG parameters.  Reasons for impact investing via ESGESG investing, although a new concept in India, is being accepted fast by investors and is especially seeing an accelerated demand since COVID-19 crisis. This can be seen with the influx of ESG thematic funds in recent years such as AXIS AMC, ICICI Prudential & Quantum India AMC coming up with their ESG Funds. SBI Mutual Fund has also reclassified its equity fund as an ESG Fund. Companies that follow good practices are believed to eventually generate higher profits through brand building and continued customer patronage. One of the examples of responsible companies in India is the Tata Group. Recently, it set an example through an initiative to provide accommodation at Taj Hotel to healthcare staff members and other frontline workers during the initial days of the Covid-19 pandemic. In the long run, such actions by companies can cause better profits and increased brand loyalty.A company that follows ESG in the long term can emerge as a sustainable establishment. This is the major reason why ESG investing is also called sustainable investing.List of ESG Funds in IndiaHere is a list of ESG funds available for investment in India:Aditya Birla Sun Life ESG FundAxis ESG FundICICI Prudential ESG FundKotak ESG Opportunities FundMirae Asset ESG Sector Leaders ETFQuantum India ESG Equity FundSBI Magnum Equity ESG FundShould you invest in ESG Funds?Since ESG funds are still evolving in India, few investors are comfortable including these in their portfolios.

Thus, the credibility of available information continues to be a hindrance in the growth of ESG investments in India.Absence of measurement standards: The Indian market currently lacks standardisation around ESG investing.

This aspect too curbs the growth of ESG investing in India. Limited track record of ESG funds: In India, ESG funds have started emerging in the past 2-3 years. Hence, there is also a lack of track record of ESG funds which may put off many investors from exploring this investing option.Lack of awareness: ESG investing is slowly gaining popularity among investors, but there’s not much awareness among many about this aspect. More and more investors need to be made aware of the benefits of ESG investing to broaden the market horizon of the same.ConclusionESG in today’s world applies to all businesses and companies are increasingly realising its contribution.
