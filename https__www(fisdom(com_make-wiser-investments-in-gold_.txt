However, we Indians love gold and just cannot let it go. It would be hard to find a person who has not invested in gold in one form or another. There are those who buy gold jewelry for different occasions like weddings, festivals, etc., while others look to make a profit. “Gold is not an investment at all!” said the Vanguard founder and former CEO, John Bogle in an interview with CNN. “Gold is speculation. It has absolutely no underlying intrinsic value,” said the American investor, who is known for promoting Mutual Funds. An investment that only recently became popular among the average investor for its low-cost and high earning schemes. Did you know that you can invest in gold through Mutual Funds? This investment vehicle collects the money and invests in physical gold without the hassles of storage and low yield. There are two ways you can go about it. One is to invest Gold Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) and the other is to simply invest in Gold Funds. Let’s see how they differ from each other :Gold ETFGold FundInvestor trades in the physical gold through an exchange.A Mutual Fund scheme which invests on the Gold ETF and other related assets.Can be purchased from the stock exchange and requires a Demat account.Can be purchased in Mutual Funds without a Demat account.Gold ETFs are priced transparently based on international gold prices.Gold Funds invest in Gold ETFs and other related assets, their NAVs are dependent on gold prices as well as prices of other assets that funds hold.Gold ETFs typically require a minimum investment amount of 1gm gold which is close to Rs 3,000 at current prices.Gold Funds allow a minimum investment of Rs 1,000 (as monthly SIP).If you were determined to purchase gold, do so with the better investment vehicle. Since Gold Funds are professionally managed, they are preferred over physical gold, even though it holds less liquidity.
