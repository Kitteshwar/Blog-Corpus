The entire information and breakup will be available under ‘Shareholding Pattern’Why is a company’s share holding pattern crucial for investorsShareholders ‘own’ the company and can question the management over its decisions related to the business. Long term investors are those who stay with a company during its growth journey and their primary motive is to profit from its business. They can generate great wealth if the company does well.Let us see how certain categories of shareholders impact or help in decision making :  High promoter stakeA promoter works for the best interest of the company and thus an increase in promoter stake is generally considered positive. Promoters can increase shareholding by way of open offer or buyback in anticipation of good growth in future. In case the promoter is decreasing stake continuously, it can be taken as a warning sign. An Offer for Sale by the promoter, however, is not a worrying sign.High FII stakeFIIs are generally seen as deploying money in stable, well researched companies.They are considered to have the best analysts as well as an expert team of Fund Managers. FII backing for a company is generally considered a positive.Mutual funds, banks and insurance companiesA significant stake by these large investors is a good sign as the company is considered to be in a long term growth trajectory. How to analyze a company’s shareholding patternBefore picking up shares of a company, it is important to review the Shareholding pattern, for both traders as well as investors. Some of the key Shareholding facts to look at, are discussed here :  A significantly high promoter stake is generally not favorable from a management decision making perspective and thus a balanced, diverse shareholding pattern is considered better.A decrease in shareholding by promoters should not always be construed as negative. It may, in fact, signify acquisition or business expansion and thus can be positive for the long term future outlook of the company.Promoters selling stake through the open market might indicate something negative. Share Buyback increases promoter stake, but may not necessarily be positive for investors.   Multiple changes in shareholding across quarters holds greater significance than just looking at the annual changes and should be scrutinized closely.  Pledged shares or shares used as a collateral should be studied carefully for any risk associated with the company’s debt situation or promoters using the funds / reserves elsewhere. Diversified and balanced Shareholding pattern ensures that decisions are well thought of with the best interest of the company.   SEBI’s Shareholding GuidelinesThese are the guidelines laid out by SEBI that every listed company has to follow for its shareholding pattern:Shareholding Pattern is to be disclosed every quarter to the Stock exchange the company is listed on (NSE and BSE).As per public disclosure guidelines, the names of Shareholders holding more than 1% in the company should be disclosed within the last 21 days of each quarter.Companies should have non- promoter shareholding in addition to promoter and public shareholders.Names of shareholders who are persons acting in concert or collaboration, if available, should be disclosed separately.   ConclusionIt is a good practice to check the shareholding pattern of a company before making an investment decision. A diversified set of owners evokes greater interest and gives a sense of stability, balance and sound decision making by the management.However, shareholding pattern in itself should not be the sole criteria for stock selection, rather it should be one of the many factors. FAQs1.
