This is where mutual funds could be the ticket to achieving goals and fulfiling dreams.Anybody can invest in a lump sum mutual fund or an SIP. An SIP, is a Systematic Investment Plan where you are able to make investments on a monthly basis. While SIPs are a monthly affair, they start at ₹100/month and the investment amount can always be adjusted. It allows you to invest in regular intervals.
