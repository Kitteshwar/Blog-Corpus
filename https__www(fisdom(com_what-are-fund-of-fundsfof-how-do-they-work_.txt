Above Rs.1,00,000, the tax is levied at the rate of 10% excluding cess and surcharge. In case of debt oriented funds (more than 65% investment in debt funds), the short term capital gains are charged at applicable slab rates of the investor while long term capital gains are subject to tax at 20% excluding cess and surcharge. Tax on hybrid funds is levied based on their majority composition depending whether it is equity oriented hybrid fund or debt oriented hybrid fund.Apart from this, tax is also levied on dividends received from the fund in the hands of the investor.
