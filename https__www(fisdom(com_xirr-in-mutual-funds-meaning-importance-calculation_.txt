This is a method of calculating the annualized return on investment for financial instruments, especially mutual funds. XIRR is widely used in calculating annualised returns in mutual funds as it takes into account the timing and size of all cash flows, as well as investments and withdrawals. The returns are calculated based on the actual dates of the cash flows. XIRR is therefore widely used in the calculation of annualised returns in the case of mutual funds investment through SIPs (Systematic Investment Plans) or SWPs (Systematic Withdrawal Plans) as it provides a more accurate measure of the actual return on investment. Steps to calculate XIRR for mutual fund investmentXIRR is an inbuilt function in MS excel and is used by investors, analysts, financial advisors, and fund managers to simplify the efforts in the calculation of XIRR. The steps to calculate the XIRR in MS Excel are given below. The first step is to tabulate all the cash flows  (investments and purchases to be marked in negative) and their corresponding dates in two adjacent columns.The last data entry in the excel should be the current redemption amount (marked as a positive entry) and the current date in respective columns. The next step is to use the XIRR formula by selecting the cells as per the syntax.The required syntax is XIRR (values, dates, [guess])The Guess parameter is optional (if no value is put against it, excel uses a value of 0.1) and runs the calculation until the result is accurate within 0.000001%.Why is XIRR important in mutual funds?XIRR is a widely used measure to calculate annualised returns for mutual fund investments as it provides more precise and accurate results after considering the timing of the cash flows as well as its size.
