The cKYC was first introduced in the union budget of the year 2012-2013. This is a directive of the Indian Ministry of Finance and has been in operation from the year 2016. Background on CKYCThe aim of the cKYC directive is to create a single platform for customer verification and reduce the hassle of the KYC verification process every time an individual has a financial interaction. cKYC aims at creating a single database where all the KYC information of all customers is verified and stored, this database is called the Central KYC Records Registry or the CKYCR.The cKYC is managed by the Central Registry of Securitisation Asset Reconstruction and Security Interest of India or CERSAI and helps to reduce the burden of producing various KYC documents for verification.How does cKYC work?Unlike the KYC verification which needs to be done at every step, the cKYC needs to be verified just once before availing any financial services.
