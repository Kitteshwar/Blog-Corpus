The cardholder has to pay at least one of these amounts to ensure that they continue to enjoy the credit limit for the next credit cycle.The minimum amount due on credit cards is a small portion of the total amount due. This is the basic amount that has to be paid by the cardholder if he/she is unable to pay the entire credit amount due for that period. How to calculate the minimum amount due on a credit card?The minimum amount due on credit cards is 5% of the total amount due.

These charges approximately range from Rs.100 to Rs.1,000 depending on the amount due and the credit card provider.Dangers of only paying the minimum amount dueWhen a cardholder does not pay the credit card dues, they are charged with a penalty interest of 3% to 4% per month. These charges are further subject to the levy of service tax. Also, the credit score of the cardholder is further affected adversely which will have long term repercussions on the cardholder. However, when the cardholder only pays the minimum amount due on the credit card, they eventually land in a debt trap and it becomes quite difficult to come out of it. The dangers of paying only the minimum amount due as against the entire amount are highlighted below.The amount due on the credit card will keep multiplying if the cardholder is in the habit of only paying the minimum amount due for each credit cycle. The cardholder will be charged interest on the unpaid amount of the dues for the previous credit period.Also, the cardholder will be charged interest immediately from the date of purchase if only the minimum amount due is paid for the previous billing cycle.The burden of interest and service tax on such interest will further add to the dues of the cardholder.Paying the minimum amount due for each credit cycle will effectively negate the availability of a free credit period on account of the charges mentioned above.When the cardholder is unable to pay the dues consistently and relies on payment of the minimum amount due to continue availing the benefit of the credit limit for the subsequent credit cycles, it also reflects poorly on the credit score of the cardholder.ConclusionPaying the minimum amount due is a benefit that the banks provide to the cardholders.
