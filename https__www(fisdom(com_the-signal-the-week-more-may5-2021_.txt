The Need For Banks & NBFCs Is The Feed For Country’s GrowthBrining efficiency to country’s finances will require new entrants and newer tech to mould old systems. While planning expenditure is a good 1st step, prioritizing it is the next needed step as spending levels were akin to H1FY20 levels, owing to curbs applied to many departments. Covid 19 continues to be bearer of bad news.

With Rs.6,000 Cr raised via bonds, NIIF aims to target raising Rs. 1.1 Lakh Crore by 2025 to help immunize India to current scenariosThe world’s largest vaccine maker looks to scale-up infrastructure via spending monies in near-&-long terms. India continues to overwhelm its resource utilization capacity by being more resource-rich in every nook. In attempting to make Co-vid become Go-vid, country gears up to grow a heavy consumption – capex – employment vertical to breathe new confidence into currently underconfident economic growth parameters.4. Economy To Expedite In Coming TimesIndia to observe 2nd consecutive negative growth quarter, pushing it into recession… but (importantly) on its own admission. The Relief Package’s priority on manufacturing and job creation, has merited revising estimates on upside. Agencies like RBI, Morgan Stanley, BoA, ICRA, Care, etc. expect India to deliver in the positive sooner than soon. Same Sentiment reflected by FII monthly net buy volume at Rs.45K Cr – more than in last 2 years.The rage of Virus and Volatilities in international markets coupled with India’s 2020 tactics to tackle 2020 issues, is bearing fruit as individuals and institutions acknowledge India’s growth trajectory. Shifting from Covid-19 to Go-vid 21, has growth drivers putting the pedal to the metal. Revision in estimates show rejuvenation of their belief in India today and its economic aspirations in the years to come.5. G20 Meet & Greet Gives India A Positive Report CardEconomic Multilateralism and National Capacity Building will help nations recover from covid disruptions.
