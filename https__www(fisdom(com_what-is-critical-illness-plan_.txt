The claim is paid when the disease is diagnosed. Claims are paid if the policyholder survives for a specified waiting period or a survival period which is around 90 days. Payout is in two forms: 1. Additional Payouts: a part of the sum assured will be paid 2. Accelerated Payouts: benefit paid over and above the base sum assured. For example, the sum assured is Rs1 crore. The critical illness has a sum assured of Rs10 lakh. If the person dies six months after contracting cancer, then under the accelerated payout she will be paid Rs10 lakh for cancer. After crossing the survival period, on death, the nominee will receive Rs 90 lakh. In case of additional payout, she will be paid Rs10 lakh on completion of the survival period. On death, her nominee will receive Rs1 crore.Thus, a critical illness health insurance policy helps you to mitigate emergencies which if unattended, would be fatal.“When the unthinkable happens, the lighthouse is hope.
