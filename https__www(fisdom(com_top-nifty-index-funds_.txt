These are passively managed funds. The investment in stocks is also made in the same proportion as in the index. These funds do not aim to beat the indices like Nifty 50 or Sensex but to mirror the index performance. Index funds are increasingly preferred by many investors because of the low management fees, as these do not require fund managers to design strategies on stock selection.Here, we will learn some basics of index funds and also some top-performing Nifty index funds to invest in.

An index fund provides broader market exposure, has low operating expenses, and also minimal portfolio turnover. Index funds adopt a passive investment strategy as they seek to match the risk and return profile of the market. The theory that index funds follow in the long-term is that the market will outperform any individual stock investment.What are the benefits of investing in Nifty Index Funds?Here are some benefits offered by Nifty Index fund investments:Index funds follow passive investment strategy and therefore replicate the index constituents. This way, the portfolio mix is simple and also easier to monitor as compared to individual stock investments.These involve far lesser cost as compared to other mutual funds since there is no need for active management around stock-selection strategies.Nifty index funds have historically generated healthy returns in the long term. The NSE Nifty index base year is 1995 and has seen 11-fold returns in the past 23 years. This means an index fund following Nifty would have made similar returns in those years. The Nifty is well tracked and offers a macro view that is based on historical data. This is much easier to follow as compared to specific stock performance. Index funds may also overcome the selection bias, since the portfolio composition is not at the discretion of fund managers. Since index funds are passive funds, these just track the index. Top Nifty Index Funds to invest in 2023Mentioned below are some top Nifty index funds in India:Aditya Birla Sun Life Nifty 50 Index Fund GrowthAbout the fundThis is an open-ended equity scheme tracking Nifty 50 TRI.
