These categories are based on the services offered.Full-service brokers: These brokers offer all-inclusive services, such as:stock trading assistance currency tradingcommodities tradingresearch managing sales and assets of investorsexpert adviceassets required for bankingThese traditional brokers charge anywhere between 0.01% to 0.50% for delivery as well as intraday trading.Discount brokers: Discount brokers generally provide an efficient trade execution platform for dealing in stocks and commodities. These new-age brokers offer lower charges but may not necessarily offer investment advice. They charge a fixed brokerage fee per trade:For example – a flat brokerage of Rs. 10 or Rs. 50 for intraday and delivery trading. Some discount brokers may not charge any fees for delivery trading.Calculation of brokerage feesEvery broker or broking firm will specify the brokerage fees in the contract with the investor or trader. There are 3 commonly available brokerage plans in India:Unlimited monthly trading planBrokerage as a percentage of volume tradedFlat per-trade brokerage fee Discount brokers may generally offer Option 1 or 3. In case of a flat brokerage fee per trade, irrespective of the volume or trade value, the broker will charge a fixed brokerage cost per order executed. The traded value could be Rs. 1,000 or even Rs. 10,00,000, but the brokerage applicable will remain flat. Some discount brokers may offer the unlimited monthly trading plan, which involves a flat fee for monthly or yearly plans. These plans allow investors to make unlimited trades within the period and are ideal for heavy traders.While the first and third brokerage categories are easily understandable, here is an example of calculating brokerage as a percentage of volume traded. Suppose an investor purchases 1000 shares of Infosys at Rs. 500 each. He sells these shares after a week at Rs. 550 each. Thus, the value of this trade is:= (1000 x 500) + (1000 x 600) = ( 5,00,000 + 6,00,000) = 11,00,000Since this is a delivery trade, a standard brokerage of say 0.4% is applicable. Thus, the brokerage charges can be calculated by applying this percentage on the trade value:= 11,00,000 x 0.4% = 4,400So, an investor, for buying and selling 1000 shares of Infosys, will have to pay a brokerage of Rs. 4,400. Thus, if an investor trades for a lower volume, he has to pay less brokerage.Many brokerage houses allow investors to negotiate the brokerage charges, thus giving investors an opportunity to make the most of the initial capital while starting off with stock market investments.Other charges related to stock tradingSome of the other charges/fees apart from brokerage charges that stock market investors must be aware of are:Securities Transaction Tax/STTSTT is a tax charged during purchase and sale of securities that are listed on stock exchanges.

STT of 0.05% will be applicable in case of options trading.Goods and Services tax/GSTCurrently, 18% (9% for central government and 9% for state) of GST is applicable on the brokerage charges. Stamp dutyThe stamp duty fee is applied on the transaction value for securities transactions.SEBI turnover feesSEBI levies turnover fees on all the securities transactions that are executed in the stock market.
