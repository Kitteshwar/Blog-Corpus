Most economists suggested looking through the exaggerated growth number, which presents a false sense of normalcy even as the rampaging second wave of the pandemic in April forced many states to impose lockdowns, hurting industrial activity.Element TrajectoryIndia’s road to economic recovery is laden with more bumps than previously expected as it consolidates with diverse undercurrents across different segments. The bouts of recovery are met with doubts of the unforeseen as Asia’s third largest economy faces uncertainty amidst a second wave of coronavirus. Vaccination diplomacy is key in printing problems and solutions to India Inc’s health & wealth.The jumping of eight core sectors by 56.1% (due to low base effect) further lop-sides IIP growth as it accounts for 40.27% of the IIP index. The first half of this financial year is expected to carry similar patterns.IIP numbers highlight the nascent and fragile stage of recovery that the Indian economy was in. We continue to keep an eye on efficient implementation of public policies which can be expected to bolster the economy at large. Resurgence of health risks in fragmented pockets of the nation, disrupted supply-side economics and overtly cautious retail consumption continue to be prominent risks to India’s full-blown economic recovery.Click Here to read MoSPI’s original press release on ‘Quick estimates of index of industrial production and use – based index for the month of April, 2021’  Macroscope  Macroscope – Government Finances: Way Ahead 04 Jun  1 minute   Macroscope  Macroscope – Eight Core Industries Update 03 Jun  0 minutes   Macroscope  Macroscope – Indian Industrial Production (IIP) | Index For The Month May 2021 14 Jul  2 minutes   Macroscope  Macroscope – Inflation | CPI Inflation For The Month June 2021 13 Jul  3 minutes   Macroscope  Macroscope – Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) – Services PMI for the month June 2021 05 Jul  3 minutes   Macroscope  Macroscope – Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) – June 2021 02 Jul  3 minutes   Macroscope  Macroscope – CPI Inflation For The Month May 2021 15 Jun  3 minutes   Macroscope  Macroscope – WPI Inflation For The Month May 2021 15 Jun  3 minutes   Macroscope  Macroscope – Purchasing Managers’ Index – Services PMI for the month May 2021 10 Jun  3 minutes   Macroscope  Macroscope – RBI Monetary Policy Meet – Policy Update for the month June 2021 04 Jun  3 minutes   Macroscope  Macroscope – Purchasing Managers’ Index – Manufacturing PMI for the month May 2021 01 Jun  3 minutes   Macroscope  Macroscope – Inflation – WPI Inflation For The Month April 2021 19 May  3 minutes
