Sadly, there is a due date for filing and submitting your taxes. If you miss the due date you face penalties and fines. To avoid this penalty people scramble to file their taxes at the last possible minute. This last-minute tax-filing process is followed by the ever-present question – how to save the last-minute tax?Many of you must have scratched your head some assessment year or the other thinking about escaping the last-minute tax. Did you find a way?If not, here are 5 easy tips which let you escape that last-minute tax liability –Invest in ELSS ELSS is a very popular mutual fund scheme which stands for Equity-Linked Saving Schemes. Investments in ELSS schemes qualify for tax exemption under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act. You can invest a maximum of Rs.1.5 lakhs for claiming tax exemption under Section 80C. Since you are doing a last-minute investment, you should invest in a lump sum. ELSS investments are at the top of the list for two main reasons. First, these are equity-oriented mutual fund investments which give very attractive returns. Secondly, the interest generated and the redemption proceeds are both tax-free in your hands. So, you not only save tax on your investments but also save tax on the returns. It is a win-win situation, isn’t it?Claim HRAHouse Rent Allowance or HRA as it is popularly called is an allowance provided by your employer if you live in a rented accommodation. HRA forms a component of your salary structure and can be claimed to get tax exemptions. The Income Tax Act specifies the maximum HRA which you can claim as tax deduction. It is lower of the following:The actual HRA component of your salary,Excess rent paid over 10% of your salary, or50% of your basic salary if you live in a metro city or 40% of your salary if you live in a non-metro city.Let us understand your HRA computation for tax purposes with the help of the following example:Your basic monthly salaryRs.50,000HRA component of the salary (monthly)Rs.15,000Rent paidRs.12,000City of residenceMumbaiExempted monthly HRA would be lower of the following:HRA component which is Rs.15,000Rent paid – 10% of the salary = Rs.12,000 – Rs.5000 = Rs.700050% of the basic salary (for metro city) = Rs.25, 000Since the lowest is Rs.7000, the exempted HRA is (Rs.7000*12) = Rs.84, 000Keep your medical bills safe and use themDid you know that your employer also allows you a tax-free medical reimbursement of up to Rs.15, 000 every year? Yes, it is true. If you submit your medical bills to your employer, you can get a medical reimbursement for such bills up to a maximum of Rs.15, 000. This reimbursement is tax-free and helps you save tax. However, the reimbursement is available only if you furnish the original bills. So, keep all your medical bills safe to claim a tax exemption at the last moment.Claim LTALTA stands for Leave Travel Allowance and is another useful tool to reduce your tax liability.

Travelling expenses incurred on you and your family could be claimed as an exemption under LTA. LTA is tax-free under Section 10(5) of the Income Tax Act.
