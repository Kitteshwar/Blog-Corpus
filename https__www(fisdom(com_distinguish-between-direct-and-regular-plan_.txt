Suppose if we buy any product online, you prefer to have free delivery. Why you do that? In order to reduce costs, you’ll try to cut the additional expenses which you don’t want to incur. Here, you do the same with the Mutual Funds.In the market, we can buy Mutual funds in 2 ways:Directly from Asset Management Company (AMC) – Direct PlanWe choose to buy through an intermediary – Regular PlanIn Regular plan, you buy mutual funds through an intermediary such as brokers, distributors or advisors. And these agents will charge a commission for the services they provide where your expenses on investments will be high. As you know that these brokers will never sell you the products that you need. They always try to push the schemes which earn a good profit to them.Now let’s look at Direct Plans. Direct Plan is a new regulation which is enforced by SEBI on January 1, 2013. In the Direct Plan, as an investor, you can directly buy the mutual funds from the Asset Management Company (AMC), where there will be no involvement of any brokers or intermediaries and these funds which you buy are commission free.The great advantage of Direct Plans is that NAV (Net Asset Value i.e., the value per share) is more when compared to Regular Plan which means that you earn more on your investments. For example, if you invest Rs 10 lakhs in both the Direct Plan and Regular Plan. The direct plan offers 17- 19% of returns whereas the Regular Plan offers 14-15% of returns. Thus, With Direct Plans you can earn 1-15% more returns than Regular Plans.And here you have a platform to make an investment in Direct Plan- Fisdom  with zero commission and zero fees.
