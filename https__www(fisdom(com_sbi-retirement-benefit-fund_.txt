On a lighter note, retirement is characterized in 1 of 2 ways:Waking up in the morning with nothing to do, and having retired before doing itThat period when you stop lying about your age and lying ‘round the houseRetirement is the 1 common goal we all aspire to enjoy care-free irrespective of working age, and socio-economic differences. However, while India enjoys one of the healthiest work-friendly demographic distribution vis-à-vis other countries, it suffers from lack of planning for post-work life.
