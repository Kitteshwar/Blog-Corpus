Some of the key features of a global health insurance plan are,Adequate coverage The cost of medical attention in India is quite high. However, this cost is further increased when any medical attention is sought in a foreign nation. Therefore, the person seeking global health insurance plans should ensure that the coverage is adequate to meet the expensive hospitalizations as well as private healthcare facilities. It is important to not forget to account for inflation as well while seeking a good and affordable global health insurance plan.Coverage for the cost of travel and medical evacuation The cost of frequent travel to a foreign country for medical treatments as well as the cost of transportation through ambulances or emergency evacuation facilities like a helicopter in such a country can be quite expensive for an average person. Hence, such costs are included in the global health insurance plans to ease the burden of the insured party. Coverage for pre-existing diseases Most health insurance plans have a fixed set of inclusions. These inclusions can vary from insurer to insurer, however, the important thing to remember is to disclose all the pre-existing diseases and to ensure coverage for the same in the health insurance plans. This will help the insured party reduce the cost of medical treatments. Access to other medical needs A good global health insurance plan can also include coverage for other medical needs like maternity benefits, dental benefits, etc. in the global health insurance plan. The premium of these insurance plans may increase based on the amount of coverage, however, will definitely be lower as compared to the costs to be paid due to lack of insurance. Adequate inclusions The majority of costs related to medical attention are usually due to OPD charges or emergency room charges.

Many plans also add global coverage as an add-on depending on the guidelines of the insurer. The tax deduction on such plans will be in line with the overall deduction available under Section 80D. Network of hospitals An important factor to consider while opting for a global health insurance plan is the network of hospitals it has to provide good and timely medical attention. A plan that has the maximum network of hospitals under its belt should be preferred to ensure quick and hassle-free solutions to their needs. Hassle-free claim settlement process The claim settlement process of any insurance plan is often the make-or-break criteria for people choosing between health care plans. An insurer who has the reputation of providing hassle-free claim settlement will definitely have an edge over others as no one today has the time and patience to deal with a cumbersome claim settlement process with multiple issues and hurdles to clear. Conclusion Health insurance plans have become the need of the day and with the growing globalization and tourism, the need for global health insurance plans has also seen tremendous growth. Such plans ensure that the insured person not only gets quality medical attention in the country but can avail of the same abroad if the need arises. FAQsAre medical tests mandatory for global health insurance plans?Yes.
