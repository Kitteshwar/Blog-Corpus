It emphasizes the safety, convenience, and affordability of investing in mutual funds, making them a suitable investment option for everyone.How did the mutual fund sahi hai campaign start?Historically, Indian investors have preferred investing in physical assets more than financial savings. However, in the past few decades, this trend is seen to be changing with more preference towards financial savings. This is primarily done with the objective to beat inflation. With equity mutual funds, for example, investors can gain far higher returns when compared to traditional saving forms. The Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI) launched ‘Mutual Funds Sahi Hai’ as an investor awareness campaign, which turned out to be a success. AMFI is known to have launched several campaigns over the years to build customer confidence and pass on education to investors while guiding them on the concept of mutual funds. It focuses on strengthening the mutual fund industry in India to imbibe higher professional standards along with a constant focus on ethics. It also aims to promote and protect investor interest for long-term benefits.How mutual fund investors benefit from ‘Mutual Fund Sahi Hai’ campaignMutual fund investments come with certain risks due to market uncertainties and frequent volatilities. Also, a fund’s performance depends on how well the fund manager is equipped for decision making and devising the right investment strategies to protect investor’s interests while ensuring safety of capital. Every investor expects that their investment grows over time and they fetch returns as expected. Thus, it is important that every mutual fund house communication is as per SEBI guidelines and AMCs follow the rules designed by AMFI to help and guide the investing population.In an effort to grow the category on the one end and educate the investor on the advantages of investing in mutual funds, AMFI is moving in the right direction to help all the mutual fund brands.

Managed by fund managersThe primary benefit of investing in mutual funds is that these are managed by fund managers who strategize investments to maximise returns for investors. Fund managers are hired by AMCs based on their experience and success in managing funds to generate above par returns.2. No need for market knowledgeAnother benefit of these investments is that anyone can invest in them, irrespective of whether one has market knowledge or not. This is because investors can easily rely on fund managers to look after the investment decision making in a mutual fund.3. Possibility of inflation beating returnsMutual funds, especially equity funds, have the potential to generate inflation-beating returns. For these, investors have to stay invested for a longer duration and be prepared to take on some level of risks.4. Caters to all risk profilesRisk-averse investors have the option of investing in debt funds, since these are often low-to-moderate risk. Investors who want higher returns and are willing to take on higher risks can consider equity funds, especially for long-term investment. 5. Option to park surplus fundsInvestors who want to park their surplus funds can consider investing in liquid funds, like debt funds, and earn higher returns as compared to savings bank account returns.How to choose the Sahi Mutual Fund?Choosing the right mutual fund requires careful consideration of various factors.
