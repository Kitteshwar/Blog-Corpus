We started fisdom with the vision of simplifying financial advice and making financial investments accessible to everyone. We spent 6 months building fisdom before beta launching it on 4th Jan 2016. We were taking baby steps in this adventurous journey and our initial aim was to build a product that customers  love to use (VCs call it product market fit!) Let me share some more detailsEvolution of the ProductImagine the transformation of a silkworm to a beautiful butterfly. Yes, that’s what defines the first and the current version of fisdom. fisdom made its impact in the industry felt with its pioneering digital onboarding experience, something that the rest of the industry soon followed. Imitation is the best form of flattery But we really weren’t done yet. Over the next 12 months, we launched features such fund selection, fund description, reporting and algorithmic redemption. And 2017 promises much more on this frontStrategic PartnershipsIt’s a different level of high when Banks bank upon us. We are a proud wealth management partner of Bank of Baroda and will redefine the digital investment experience for their 6 crore retail customers. Stay tuned as we shall announce another partnership with a leading private sector bank in the next few weeks. We are happy to share that India’s top corporates like Wipro, Tech Mahindra, Genpact, Quess, Indecomm, have chosen fisdom as the preferred advisor to their employees.TeamFrom 5 passionate employees, we have grown into a strong family of 35 rockstars spread across Bangalore and Mumbai covering the engineering, operations, and marketing functions. Our commitment towards building a great product is reflected in our employee mix. We are probably the only financial services company where the engineering team is bigger than the operations team! We have a strong engineering team that has worked in places like Uber, Redbus, Tata Elxsi, Tesco, Borques etc.Capital raising and external recognition:Saama Capital (a leading early stage venture capital firm that has backed PayTM and Snapdeal) has backed fisdom along with several other Angel Investors. We shall be using this investment in building a product which you would love to invest your time and money with! We have had several pats on our back in this short journey. We were awarded the best Fintech Startup at the IBM Fintech Startup challenge. Our customers became our biggest advocates as we were recognized as one of the top performers in the mutual fund segment by Bombay Stock Exchange.Roadmap for 20172016 has been an eventful year for the global economy. With Demonetization, Brexit, US elections results, it didn’t leave any stone unturned to surprise us at every juncture. Such is life, full of strange turns and uncertainties. Under such unpredictable times, we resolve to safeguard the financial interests of our customers by helping them make sound financial decisions to keep their long term goals intact. We are working on a product roadmap which shall culminate in a host of features to make your financial life simpler. Our objective for 2017 is to transform fisdom into a holistic wealth management experience for our customers. On behalf of everyone at fisdom, I thank you once again for the trust invested in us. Every member of our company is aligned towards rewarding the trust that you have put in us, by working for you in building your wealth. We look forward to serving you better in the coming years.
