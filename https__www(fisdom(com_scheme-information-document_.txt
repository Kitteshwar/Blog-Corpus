These documents specifically contain simple language, which is clear and easy to understand.What is contained in a Scheme Information Document?Here are some of the details contained in SID that every mutual fund investor should understand before investing:Investment objective:The investment objective of a scheme states the main aim of the scheme. Some examples of different investment objectives adopted by mutual fund schemes are:tax benefitlong-term capital appreciation, consistent returns, etc.This section also tells investors how the scheme plans to achieve the stated objectives. By looking at a scheme’s investment objective, investors can gauge whether it is in alignment with their personal investment goals. In case a scheme’s objective is modified, the fund house has to mandatorily update the SID for the same.Investment amount and related detailsThe SID includes information like:The minimum amount for various scheme-related transactionsInvestment amount for Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) optionInvestment amount for lump-sum transactionsMinimum redemption amountMinimum transaction amount for Switching of fundsSystematic Transfer Plan (STP) and Systematic Withdrawal Plan (SWP)In this section of SID, investors can also find details such as fees and expenses that are applicable to the scheme, such as:Expense ratio, Exit load,Transaction charges, etc.A scheme with a lower expense ratio can allow higher net returns in the hands of investors. However, while taking an investment decision, investors must consider other factors in combination with the expense ratio instead of solely focusing on expense ratio.Risk of investmentMutual fund investment can come with risks like:Interest rate risk, Risk of loss due to equity exposure,Portfolio concentration risk, Liquidity risk, etc. These risks may impact the capital appreciation that investors expect from the investment. Risks of equity mutual funds may be different from those of debt funds, both in terms of nature and level.SID elaborates the associated risk factors that could impact the fund performance. Some of the factors that could be listed in SID are:Changes in tax rates, Political uncertainties, Regulatory changes, Demand-supply dynamics, Macroeconomic factors that could affect the company,Impact of interest rate changesCredit worthiness, Liquidity, etcSID also states the different measures that the scheme will likely undertake for controlling or mitigating some of these risks. Some of these measures can include:diversification, active portfolio management, liquidity management, etc.Scheme’s strategyThe SID also contains the fund’s investment strategy, which should be minutely studied by investors. Every mutual fund scheme will have a unique strategy which can impact an investor’s investment decision. This section of the SID gives insight into the fund manager’s approach for building and managing the scheme’s portfolio. It also states the overall exposure of the fund through investment in different types of investment instruments across asset classes. Percentage asset allocationThe scheme information document states the portion (in percentage) of the fund’s pool that will be allocated to different asset classes, like equity, debt, gold, etc. Under normal market conditions, the fund has to maintain the percentage of allocation as stated in the SID.A small-cap fund, for instance, has to invest a minimum 80% of its assets in equity belonging to small-cap companies. The remaining can be invested in other areas such as large caps, debt or money market instruments. A fund that allocates a larger portion of its pool to riskier asset categories like mid-caps and small-caps may be highly exposed to market volatilities. This information can help investors judge the scheme’s risk profile before making an investment.Historical performanceMutual fund schemes that have been in the market for some time will state historical performance details in the SID. Historical performance details can cover different time frames and the fund’s relative performance against the benchmark index. Investors must, however, remember that a scheme’s historic returns cannot be used as an indication of its potential future performance. While gauging the potential of a scheme, investors can look at its long-term performance rather than short-term. Fund managersThe fund managers of a mutual fund scheme are directly responsible for the performance of actively managed mutual funds. Hence, investors must look for fund manager details in the SID, such as:fund manager profile experience, etc.ConclusionWhile SID can be as long as close to 100 pages, it is important that investors read the above-mentioned details to help them ascertain the scheme’s suitability to their needs and take an informed investment decision.FAQsWhat should I look for in a scheme information document?The scheme information document or SID gives information like NFO dates, highlights, summary of the scheme, historical performance, fund manager details, objective, etc. These details are crucial for an investor to make an apt investment decision.What is a key information memorandum?Key information memorandum or KIM is a concise form of the scheme information document or SID.
