It is a study of multiple candlestick patterns and is used to map the reversal trend. The first candlestick in this pattern is the mother candle with a larger body and the following candle is one with a smaller body representing the child which is embodied by the previous larger candle. These candles together create the visual illusion of a pregnant woman hence the name. There can be two types of harami candlestick patterns representing a bullish pattern and a bearish pattern. 1. Bullish harami patternA bullish harami candlestick pattern is formed when the stock or the asset is in a trend reversal from the existing bearish trend or the downward trend. This pattern indicates that the bulls are in control and the prices of the stock or the asset are on the rise. 2. Bearish harami patternA bearish harami candlestick pattern is formed when the stock or the asset is in trend reversal from the existing bullish trend or an upward trend. When this pattern is formed it indicates that the bulls are losing the ground and the bears are taking control. The pressure is on the selling side and the prices of the asset or the stock are on a downward slope. How to identify harami candlesticks?The harami candlestick pattern like the inverted hammer candlestick pattern is a visual pattern that can be easily spotted by the traders and analyzed. The ways to identify the bullish harami and the bearish harami candlestick patterns are mentioned below.1. Bullish harami pattern A bullish harami candlestick pattern is formed when the mother candle or the larger candle is in red on Day 1 of the trading session. On the following day, the other candle formed is green in colour and may not be more than 25% of the previous day’s candle. The second candle will go mid-way up than the previous day’s candle if the stocks are gaping up. This pattern indicates the reversal of the downtrend to a bullish trend.2. Bearish harami patternA bearish harami candlestick pattern is when the mother candlesticks or the larger candle on day 1 of the trading session is green in colour. On day two of the trading session, a smaller candle is formed that is red in colour and the prices have gapped down. The opening day 2 trading session of the stock or the asset is with a price that is lower than the previous day’s closing and the entire body of the day 2 candle is within the range of the previous day’s green candle. This indicates the takeover of the bearish sentiment in the market and the reversal of the bullish trend to a bearish one. How to trade using harami candlesticks?Harami candlestick pattern is the visual pattern where the traders have to wait for two or more trading sessions for the pattern to form.

Trading in case of a bullish harami patternWhen the bullish harami pattern is formed, the traders should ideally wait for the third candle to form to confirm the trend. If the third candle is green or bullish the trend reversal is confirmed. Traders can enter the market or take buy positions in such cases when the prices are preferably on the gap up and cross the highest point of the first day’s candle. It is important to always use stop loss while trading in harami patterns so the traders can limit their exposure if the pattern does not stand the market pressure and breaks. 2. Trading in case of a bearish harami patternSimilar to the bullish harami pattern, in the case of a bearish harami pattern too, the traders should wait for the third day’s candle to confirm the trend reversal. If the third days’; candle is red it confirms the trend reversal. Traders can enter the market and take suitable short positions when the prices are preferably on the gap down and cross the lowest point of the first day’s candle. In this case too, traders should always use stop loss while trading in harami patterns so they can limit their exposure if the pattern does not stand the market pressure and cracks.An important indicator of this trend reversal pattern is the volume that is traded.
