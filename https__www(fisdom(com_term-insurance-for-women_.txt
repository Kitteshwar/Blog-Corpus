Therefore, there is a growing dependency on women as much as on men. In case of an untimely death of the woman in the family, the family members may suffer financial stress. Therefore, if women have purchased term insurance plans, it can ensure that their family continues to enjoy financial stability, even in their absence.Debt and other expense obligationsMany women assume that they do not need term insurance since there is no dependency on their earnings. However, if there are any debt obligations and to cater to other monthly financial expenses, there is always a need for a strong financial back-up. Women may end up leaving their families grappling with financial troubles in their absence. With the help of a term insurance plan, women can make sure that any open debt obligations are taken care of instead of creating additional financial stress for their families. Women as homemakersFor women who have opted to be homemakers, there are still chances that their families may face difficulties in their absence. This is because the remaining family members may have to deal with many responsibilities at once. To hire additional help or support, they would require sufficient finances. As these expenses continue to add over time, it is important to safeguard one’s family through term insurance.Financial security in retirement yearsEvery woman should ensure her financial security during retirement years, whether working or homemaker. A good financial safety net for retirement can also help beat inflation and ensure a comfortable lifestyle post retirement. Term plans can offer maturity benefits which help in financial protection. By making premium payments throughout the term, women can benefit by availing the payout at maturity to fulfil various retirement goals. How can women select the right term plan for themselves?The key points that women must note while buying term plans for themselves are:Buy a term plan from a reputed and well-established insurance providerLook for a term plan that has additional benefits for womenOpt for a term plan with a good claim settlement track recordHow much does term insurance for women cost?The main determining factors for term insurance cost for women are the term plan selected, age of the applicant, and insurance cover opted. For example, if a woman who is 30 years old opts for a term insurance of Rs. 1 crore, she will have to pay in the range of Rs. 6,500 – Rs. 10,000 annually towards the plan. This is a very small portion compared to the future financial relief that a woman can enjoy. ConclusionThe importance of term insurance is fast being accepted by the younger population, especially how it can help women. It is not just a financial protection in case of an unfortunate event but also an empowering tool that ensures financial freedom for women. It is best for women to realise this early on in life so that they can save on the overall cost and ensure complete financial protection.FAQs1.Can I take term insurance for a housewife?Currently, most insurance providers in India do not have exclusive term plans designed for housewives or homemakers.
