Virgin CPRA virgin CPR is when the price of the stock does not touch the CPR lines. It is usually observed that if the price of a stock fails to touch the range the previous day, then there is approximately a 40% chance that the price of the stock will fail to break the CPR range. It is important to note that a virgin CPR can be strong support or resistance based on the current market scenario.2. Price trading at a level above TCA higher current price than the Top Central Pivot Point (TC) indicates a buying trend where the traders are ready to buy the stock even when the average price is on the higher side. In such a case, the CPR will act as a support. 3. Price trading at a level below BCWhen the current price is lower than the Bottom Central Pivot Point (BC), it indicates a seller’s market. It indicates a bearish market with many selling opportunities. Also, in such a case, CPR will act as a resistance.4. Price trading within the CPR linesWhen the current price is trading between the CPR lines, it indicates an accumulation phase and a sideways market. Traders can wait for a CPR breakout above TC with the volume in such a case. Another option is to buy at the bottom central pivot point (BC) keeping the target top central pivot point (TC) which can be done in case of wide CPR. What are the benefits of CPR?CPR indicator is an excellent technique that helps traders take profitable positions by combining different trading methods.
