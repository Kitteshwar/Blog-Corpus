Some of such most popular tax savings schemes are mentioned below.Senior Citizen Savings SchemeThis scheme is designed especially for the senior citizens of the country.

These funds are a relatively lower risk investment as compared to investing in individual stock as the risk is reduced due to a diversified portfolio. The returns on mutual funds are generally higher and the cost of investment is also not exorbitant. Senior citizens can make systematic investments in mutual funds and can gradually build a high-return earning portfolio that can provide them with the benefit of periodic returns.
