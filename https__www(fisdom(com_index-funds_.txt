For instance, an index fund that is benchmarked to NSE Nifty will buy stocks in the index and these will be in the same proportion as the index itself. The idea is to replicate returns generated by the Index that it aims to follow. Index fund investment is also known as a passive investment since investors do not have to pick stocks actively. Despite the simplicity of Index funds as investment avenues, most Indian investors are not aware of it. The few who are aware of this category of investment prefer actively managed funds because they are risk-averse and assume that Index funds may carry higher risk.If you are new to Index funds and would like to explore this investment type, we have put together a guide for the same. Read on to find out how you can start with Index fund investments. What are Index Funds?Definition of Index FundsIn simple terms, an Index fund is a kind of mutual fund which builds its portfolio using the same composition as that of a market index like Sensex or NSE Nifty. The fund invests in stocks that are part of the benchmark index selected and replicate the composition as well.Let’s consider an example to better understand this concept. If HDFC Bank and Reliance Industries Limited make up 5% and 2% respectively of Nifty 50, then the index fund, which uses Nifty 50 as a benchmark, will allocate the same percentages of the portfolio to the said stocks. Watch this video on YouTubeHow do index funds work?One unique characteristic of an Index fund is that it is not actively managed by a fund manager. Since the portfolio mirrors an index’s composition at all times, there is no necessity for a fund manager to intervene with stock selection. This results in the Index fund’s NAV moving in the same direction as the index which it follows. Why do people invest in index funds?Most Index fund investors get attracted to the diversification that it offers in an investment portfolio. Since Index funds replicate the composition of indices, there is also the attractive return factor that draws people towards them. While the Indian market still sees a very limited amount of investment in Index funds, these are slowly but surely gaining popularity as more and more investors get educated about this investment avenue.How to Invest in Index Funds?Investing in Index funds is similar to the process of mutual fund investment. This can be done either directly or through an agent/distributor. To avoid the hassle of physically visiting the mutual fund office, it is best to choose an online distributor for investment. Here is how you can go about it:Choose an Index fund for your investment (details on how to choose an ideal index fund’ can be found in the next segment)Select an online distributor through which you can make the investment. This will offer convenience as you will not require a Demat account or physical visit to the fund’s office.Go through the list of fund options available and make the investment after following KYC procedure listed out by the online distributor.How to choose an ideal index fundWhile choosing an ideal index fund, investors must consider two key factors:Lower expense ratio – An ideal index fund is one that aims to generate returns that are very close to the benchmark index’s returns. If there is a higher expense ratio associated with an index fund, the returns could be far lower than the benchmark, and it is nearly impossible to generate higher returns than the benchmark. Hence, the lower the expense ratio, the higher the chances that it will generate similar returns as the benchmark index. Lower tracking error – Variance between Index fund returns and the percentage gain/loss of the Index it follows is called tracking error. For instance, if an Index fund has gained returns of 4% and the Index has gained 4.5% then the 0.5% difference is known as tracking error. Since the primary aim of any index fund is to keep returns closer to the index, investors must look for a fund that has lesser tracking error. This means, the fund manager is constantly tracking the index and leaves very little scope of error, which would otherwise result in lower returns than the index.How to invest in Index Funds through Fisdom ?It is now easy to invest in Index funds with a few clicks using the Fisdom app on your mobile phone.

Some of the major advantages are as listed below:Lower Expense Ratio: One of the main advantages of Index funds is a lower expense ratio, which is primarily because the funds are not actively managed. The expense ratio comprises the cost related to fund operations and management fees. Investors can benefit from an expense ratio of 0.5% in Index funds against a 1-2.5% ratio in actively managed funds. For instance, one of the top-rated Index funds in India ‘ICICI Prudential Nifty Next 50 Index Fund’ has an expense ratio of 0.39%, far lower than most actively managed mutual funds.Disciplined Approach: Index funds adopt a very disciplined approach towards the selection of stocks and their proportions, as compared to fund managers randomly timing the market.Cost savings: Investors also save on brokerage costs, since the investment is based on the chosen index.Tax efficiency: Index funds can be tax-efficient apart from having comparatively lower expense ratios. The tax save mainly comes that there is no need to switch between funds depending on performance.Ideal for the risk-averse: It is an ideal investment choice for investors who are risk-averse but still want a certain level of equity exposure along with portfolio diversification benefits.Things to be Careful AboutEvery investment form comes with some set of disadvantages. Here are some of the major drawbacks of Index funds that are important for investors to consider before making an investment:Miss out on investing in Small & Mid caps: Index funds are focused on large-cap stocks and therefore have a lesser advantage as compared to actively managed funds which can have small and medium cap focus. Index funds may prove less beneficial for aggressive investors who are looking at a 7-10-year horizon. Possible investment in non-performing stocks: Index funds sometimes lay heavy dependency on high-performing stocks. The composition of an Index fund keeps changing as per the Index itself. Thus, a stock will carry heavy weightage in the fund if it weighs heavy in the Index. This will be true even if the stock is overvalued. This percentage composition cannot be modified since the fund is not actively managed. For instance, if Nifty 50 has a 5% contribution of Reliance Industries Limited stocks, the Index fund following Nifty 50 will mirror this contribution irrespective of the expected stock performance of RIL.End NoteIndex funds can be used to begin an investment journey, as it is a form of passive investment. Some investors also use it for portfolio diversification and better returns by following a benchmark index. It is up to an investor to make the most of this investment opportunity and generate strong returns through the benchmark index’s performance during upward trends.Frequently Asked QuestionsAre Index Funds good for short-term investments? Index fund investments must be made for at least 5 years to see good returns. In the short-run, these could fluctuate as per changes in the indexes that they follow. Can I invest in Index funds if I am a beginner?

There is also the benefit of diversification and comparatively lower risk involved.How do I invest in Index funds?
