The contribution made by you as an employee is a mandatory 12% of your salary.Voluntary Provident Fund (VPF) is an extension of this EPF account. The contributions you make to the VPF account are voluntary and are beyond the 12% that you make with EPF. with a VPF account you can contribute as much percentage of your salary as you want but enjoy same returns and benefits as a EPF scheme. However, as opposed to the Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF) in which the employer’s contribution is equivalent to yours, the contribution of the employer through Voluntary Provident Fund (VPF) is restricted and the maximum contribution is of the employee. But, the benefits of this are that whatever contributions you make to the VPF account are eligible for tax deductions under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act, 1961. Through your contribution to the VPF account you can enjoy significant tax benefits as well.Tax exemptions available to VPF contributionWho doesn’t want to enjoy tax exemptions while also securely investing their money?
