Tax collection allows the government to provide its citizens with the best infrastructure and other services. However, paying taxes may also deprive individuals from using their yearly gains towards personal benefit. To prevent this, many people invest in various savings schemes that allow tax deductions. There are plenty of options for tax-saving investments. One can choose any depending on personal financial goals. Here, we will discuss one such instrument that is popular for its tax benefits: National Savings Certificate (NSC).What is a National Savings Certificate?National Savings Certificate (NSC) is a tax saving investment that can be bought from any post office branch by an Indian Resident. Since this is a fixed-return, low-risk, government-backed investment, NSC is often preferred by risk-averse investors.
