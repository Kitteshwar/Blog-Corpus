In the next few minutes, we will be exploring and examining the significance of this festival and how can we relate it to Gold. While the backstory may be speculated by some, there are some significant relatable details about this festival that may give us a better idea, why Hindu and Jain communities believe that this is a good time for starting something new or crucial in life.Akshaya Tritiya and the Significance of GoldThe word ‘Akshaya’ means ‘neverending prosperity’, in fact in some versions of the meaning of this word, has a meaning closer to the significance of Gold in particular. This meaning says, ‘non-corrosive’ and that’s how the neverending aspect of Gold is articulated to Gold. Gold is the most non-reactive metals in the periodic table, which makes it last longer than any other metals in it’s purest state. A day that has an aspect of invincibility and a metal that last centuries and millennials along with the significance of prosperity with both the day and Gold being a sign of prosperity make it a perfect combination shows us the significance of this day and gold.The second word ‘Tritiya’ means the third day of prosperity, considering it one of the most powerful days to pray to conduct Hindu rituals for prosperity. While rituals and prayers are in today’s world are a debatable subject but Hindu calendar’s existence for thousands of years shows that it indeed has some spiritual energy making it an auspicious day for starting something new or better an investment. Gold is never-ending though gold-ores are limited and that is what makes Gold a great investment opportunity during Akshaya Tritiya. An ageless investment made on a day intended for invincible prosperity. Gold is significant both scientifically and spirituallyWhile spirituality is debatable in the era where science and Math dictate our decisions, it is a scientific fact that positive energy has a positive outcome. For example:  A study conducted to test the effect of music on water molecules might give us a better understanding. According to the study water molecules are aggressive with music such as metal and rock whereas with soft and classic music water molecules are calmer and less active. Likewise on a day that is filled with people’s positive energy through belief regardless of the religious significance is a good day to start your story of ‘never-ending prosperity’. Gold has proven to be one of the most lasting and stable signs of prosperity throughout the recorded history of mankind. In time, when mankind is facing an act of disciplining by Nature through diseases, questioning humankind of their unending greed, Gold remains to be something untouched, perhaps because of its non-corrosive superpowers and mankind’s faith in this metal or the simple fact that it doesn’t rust. Gold embodies the spiritual significance of undying prosperity literally scientifically and through the test of time which clearly confirms it to be a good idea to invest in Gold.Buying Gold is now easier than you thinkLet’s face it, we are no Indiana Jones and we aren’t Lara Croft searching for treasure in ancient tombs.
