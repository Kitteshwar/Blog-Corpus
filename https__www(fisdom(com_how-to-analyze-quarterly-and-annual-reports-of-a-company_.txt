Therefore it is crucial to look past the numbers and to understand the true picture that they show. The key areas in the quarterly and annual reports and their interpretation that you should look for are –Comparing the revenue, profits, and operating incomeAmong the key areas that highlight the financial position of a company are its revenues, its profit percentage, and its operating income. These figures can be used to understand the profit margins of the company, the income generated from the core operations of the company, and its dependence on non-operating income for overall profitability. Investors and other stakeholders have to review these figures and compare the same with the corresponding numbers of the previous periods. This will help them understand the growth trajectory and the relative performance of the company every quarter as well as year on year basis. Comparing interest costsEvery company requires finance for its short-term and long-term goals and borrowings are a convenient and easily accessible source for the same. While these loans have to be repaid in due course, the interest payments for the same are a mandatory cost that has to be incurred every year.It is, therefore, important for a company to have sustainable levels of debt where they can easily meet the interest costs without damaging their profit margins or their survival. Hence, it is important to analyze the interest costs in quarterly and annual reports and compare the same with previous periods as well as with peers. This will give a fair idea of whether the company is over-leveraged or if the debt is at optimum levels. Analyzing the EPS EPS stands for earnings per share and refers to the net profit available per share. It is one of the many parameters that can ascertain the value received by the shareholders at the end of the day and is a contributor to deciding if investing in the company is a sound decision. A rising EPS every quarter or year on year is a sign of a growing company. It assures the investors of the profitability of the company and gives the investors enough confidence to invest in such companies. Comparing the financial statements of corresponding periods The annual and quarterly reports include the balance sheet, profit and loss statement, cash flow statement, auditors reports, and Director’s reports for such period. These reports have to be compared with financial statements of previous corresponding periods as well as that of the competition. Such comparison can then be used to weed out the shortcomings and enhance the growth areas further helping in optimizing the available resources. Investors can compare these financial statements to review the performance of the company when compared to its past performance, its ability to meet its targets as well as its position in the industry. Focus on audit reports and management warningsAs mentioned above, the financial reports include the auditor’s reports as well as management reports. These reports have information about the company’s financial health, and future projects as well as any warnings that have the potential to harm its profitability, growth projections, or its ultimate survival in the industry. Such reports have to be reviewed and analyzed with prudence as they reflect the future of the company in the eyes of the management and its auditors, therefore, providing crucial inputs in the decision-making process. ConclusionThe annual resorts and the quarterly reports of a company are awaited by the shareholders and other stakeholders along with the market pundits too.
