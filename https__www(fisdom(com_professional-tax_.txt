Therefore, the decision to levy professional tax and the quantum for the same is dependent on the internal policies of the individual states. The Central Government, however, has the authority of determining the maximum amount of professional tax that can be levied by any state. As per the Central Government regulations, no state can levy professional tax above Rs. 2,500. The name professional tax suggests that the tax is levied on only professionals like doctors, lawyers, etc. However, that is not the case. Professional tax is levied on all professions, trades, employment, self-employed persons like persons having any business, freelancers, companies, firms, LLPs, Societies, HUFs, Insurance Agents, Tax Consultants, Surveyors, etc. Although professional tax is a form of direct tax levied by the state, it is deductible from the taxable income.  Also Read: All that you need to know about Voluntary Provident Fund deductionWho is liable to pay professional tax?Professional tax is collected by the employers on a monthly basis and deposited with the State Government.

This limit is state-specific and will therefore vary from state to state levying the professional tax. Employers or professionals having employees in their organization are also liable to pay professional tax subject to the eligibility of professional tax provisions in the state.Professionals or freelancers have to obtain the professional tax registration number to pay the professional tax against the same. This number can be obtained by submitting the application form for the same along with the required documents as power the requirements of the state in this regard.
