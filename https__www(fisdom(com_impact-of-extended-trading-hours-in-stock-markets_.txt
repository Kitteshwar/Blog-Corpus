This can be beneficial for investors looking to buy or sell large volumes of securities.Better accessibility to global marketsWith longer trading hours, Indian traders and investors can participate in global markets during their trading hours. This can help traders take advantage of market movements and news from global markets, leading to improved investment opportunities.Impact on traders and retail investorsLonger trading hours can also pose challenges for traders. This could mean longer work hours for monitoring the market, which can lead to burnout and fatigue in the long run. Additionally, extended trading hours can lead to higher transaction costs due to the increased volatility during these hours.How do the brokerages get impacted?The extended trading hours can have both positive and negative effects on brokerages. On one hand, brokerages can benefit from increased trading volumes and transaction fees. On the other hand, longer trading hours can lead to higher operational costs for brokerages, such as additional staff and technology infrastructure.ConclusionIn conclusion, while there may be some benefits to extending trading hours in India, such as reducing overnight market risk, the evidence from other exchanges is mixed, and there may be disproportionate costs for all participants.
