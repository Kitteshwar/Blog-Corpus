The issue dates for this IPO were from 4th May – 9th May 2022 and it was the biggest IPO in the country with a price band of Rs.902 – 949 per share (discount of INR 45 for retail investors) and an issue size of Rs. 21,000 crores. The shares of LIC were listed on the stock exchanges on 17th May 2022 and it was subscribed for nearly 3x over the period of the issue days 2. PayTM (One 97 Communications)PayTM IPO was launched with a lot of buzz and became the second-biggest IPO in the country. This IPO was launched between the 8th – 10th of November 2021. The PayTM IPO size is Rs. 18,300 crores and the price band for this issue was R. 2080-2150. The company was not profitable at the time of the IPO and had no remote chance of the same in near future. The IPO did not receive as much response with HNIs completely giving it a miss and was listed at a discount of 9.3% to its offer price.3. Coal IndiaCoal India is considered to be one of the biggest Navratna of the country and ranks third in terms of IPO size which was to the tune of Rs. 15,200 crores.

The retail investors were able to make marginal listing gains on account of the discount offered at the time of subscription but the IPO tanked brutally in the coming weeks. It is etched in history as one of the worst-performing IPOs in the Indian markets 9. ZomatoThis is one of the recent IPOs in the Indian market and was launched in 2021.
