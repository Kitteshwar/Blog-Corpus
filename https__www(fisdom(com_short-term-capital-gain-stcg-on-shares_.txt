The period of holding is the difference between the date of purchase of shares and the date at which they are sold. For equity shares to be classified as short-term capital assets, such shares have to be held for a period of less than 12 months. This condition is applicable in the case of equity shares that are listed on a recognized stock exchange. In the case of unlisted equity shares, the required period of holding to be classified as a short-term capital asset is 24 months. How are listing gains from IPO treated?In case of the sale of shares immediately on the listing of the shares on stock exchanges, the same will be considered as Short Term Capital gains as the holding period of shares is less than 12 months.When can the sale of equity shares be considered to be STCG?The short-term capital gains on equity shares are calculated as per provisions of section 111A.

This rate is applicable on short-term capital gains as per section 111A. In the case of short-term capital gains arising on the sale of shares outside the purview of section 111A, such gains are taxable as per the applicable slab rate of the assessee. To understand the concept of STCG better, let us take the following example.Mr. A sold the shares of Company A listed on BSE at Rs. 5,00,000. These shares were held by him for a period of 6 months and were purchased at a price of Rs. 4,60,000.In the above case, as the shares were listed, such sale will fall under the ambit of section 111A. The STCG for the sale of these equity shares is Rs. 40,000 (500000-460000). The applicable tax rate on this STCG is 15%. Therefore, the tax payable is Rs. 6,000. The tax rate applicable for STCG on sharesAs discussed above, STCG is taxed at a flat rate of 15%. However, unlike regular income, the assessee does not get the benefit of deduction under Chapter VIA. This includes deduction from Section 80C to section 80U. This condition is applicable only on STCG taxed under section 111A. Therefore, in case of assesses that have STCG that falls outside the purview of section 111A can claim deduction under Chapter VIA. Applicability of deductions and exemptions on STCGAs per Section 111A of the Income Tax Act, you can claim tax deductions on Short Term Capital Gains (STCG) to reduce your tax liabilities. You can file for short-term capital gain tax exemptions under Section 80U and Section 80C, you can claim tax deductions in line with your investments under these sections of the IT Act. These deductions or exemptions can be claimed only under Section 111A.However, no deduction is made available to individuals under Sections 80C on their tax on STCG on shares that covered under Section 111A. But individuals may claim such deductions on short-term capital gains tax on shares that are not covered under Section 111A.If your total income including STCG after applicable tax deductions is below Rs 2.5 Lakh, then your total tax liability is nil and also no liability will arise us/ 111A as deduction up to the basic tax exemption limit is allowed; Deductions from STCG under section 80C-80U. Income tax Laws do not allow any deduction under section 80C to 80U.What is the treatment of Short Term Capital Loss?Unlike long-term capital gains that were exempt prior to the budget of 2018, STCG has always been taxable. Therefore, STCL on the equity shares can set set-off against any STCG or LTCG payable by the assessee. If there is no STCG or LTCG in the current year, it can be carried forward for a period of 8 years. Such STCL can be set-off against any STCG or LTCG payable by the assessee in such 8 years. ConclusionShort-term capital gains in equity shares are taxed at the rate of 15% in the case such shares are listed on a recognized stock exchange whereas in other cases, they are taxed as per the applicable slab rates of the assessee. The taxation of equity shares held for the short term is higher than that of shares held for the long term. Hence, it is important to understand the taxation on short-term capital gains to ensure proper tax planning.  FAQsIs the sale of equity shares always a capital gain?The sale of equity shares is usually treated as capital gains.
