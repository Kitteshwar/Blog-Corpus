New definition for Pre-existing diseasesThe new guidelines state that any disease or ailment that is diagnosed 48 months prior to the issuance of the health insurance cover will be considered a pre-existing disease. Also, age-related illnesses Further, any condition whose symptoms or signs have come about within a period of three months of the date of issuance of the policy, then it will also be classified under pre-existing Diseases.

This might result in disallowing the costs of consumables and pharmacy, implants and medical devices, and diagnostics under this category.Additionally, insurers are not allowed to add any proportionate deduction for ICU charges in lieu of the fact that ICUs cannot be further categorised.7. Claims cannot be rejected after 8 yearsIf the health insurance policy holder has been consistently paying his premium for a period of 8 years or more, then claims cannot be rejected by the insurer except in the case of fraud or permanent exclusion. The 8 year period is the moratorium period.8. Wellness benefits In order to incentivise healthy lives, the recent guidelines stress on rewarding policy holders on the basis of preventive and wellness habits. This is done by disclosing upfront, mechanisms or incentives in the prospectus and the policy document, that incentivize individuals to monitor and improve their health.9. Launch of several pilot productsThe IRDAI has encouraged insurance companies to launch several health insurance products to cover risks that were outside the ambit of health insurance policies all these years. There are several continuity benefits being introduced and the insurers are also encouraged to try and test new products.10. Shorter turnaround timeAs per the new guidelines, the insurer has to settle/ reject health insurance claims within a period of 30 days from the date the claim is received.
