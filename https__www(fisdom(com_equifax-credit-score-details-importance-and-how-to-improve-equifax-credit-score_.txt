AkshathaSajumonWritten by - Akshatha SajumonOctober 12, 2021  8 minutes  What is an Equifax credit score?Equifax is one of the certified credit rating agencies in India that provides credit scores and credit reports for individuals and businesses organizations. A credit score is a three-digit number between the range of 300 to 900. This number is allotted to a person or business entity based on their detailed credit history recorded by the credit rating agency.Why is an Equifax credit score important?A credit score is one of the first reference points that is reviewed by lenders when a person or an entity applies for a loan of any nature or a credit card. The minimum credit score preferred by the lenders is 750 and more depending on the guidelines of the lenders for their respective products. A favorable credit score is one above 750 which helps the applicant get timely access to credit without any hassles or extra cost. If the credit score of the applicant is closer to 300, such applicant is considered to be a high-risk applicant with a higher possibility of default or delay in the repayment of the credit provided. The lenders may therefore not approve the loan application or the credit card application of such applicants. Hence, it is important to maintain a healthy credit score to ensure that the applicants get immediate access to credit to meet their financial needs. What are the details mentioned in the Equifax credit report?The Equifax credit report contains detailed information about the credit history of the applicant.
