IPO stands for Initial Public Offer which is essentially the first time that the shares of a company are introduced or listed in the stock markets for a subscription. Investors can subscribe to the shares of a company either through the IPO or by subsequently purchasing them through the open market or by investing in units of equity mutual funds. IPOs are one of the modes of raising capital for a company and getting listing benefits along the way. Some IPOs are issued at a discounted price which allows the investors to gain the advantage of buying shares at a lower value and aiming for short-term or long-term gains. The quality of the company and its market perception is what determines the demand for the stock post-launch of the IPO. How to invest in an IPO? IPOs usually come in two formats, Fixed Price IPOs and Book Built IPOs. in recent times, most IPOs are in the nature of Book Built IPOs, where the company lists the price band for the IPO within which investors can bid for the lots at their discretion. The process of investing in IPOs is listed below.Application processThe application for IPO can be done through online or offline modes. In the offline mode, investors will have to submit the physical IPO application to the IPO Banker or their broker. In the online format, the same form can be submitted to the broker through their online platform.Under this mode, investors will have to login into their account with the broker and select the link to the IPO. Next, they will have to select the investor type from the drop-down options as well as the number of lots that they want to bid for and the bid price.Payment for the lots can be through UPI and the same has to be submitted at the time of application. ASBAInvestors have to be aware of the ASBA (Application Supported by Blocked Amount) which is mandatory for IPOs now thereby eliminating the need for cheques or demand drafts for IPO allocation. Under this mode, the amount of shares bid by the investor is blocked from their bank account and upon allotment, the same is debited in the favour of the company. Bidding for lotsIf the IPO is Book Built IPO, investors can bid for their desired lots within the price band offered by the company. Bidding for fractions of lots is not permitted. Allotment Upon the closure of the IPO the allotment of shares beings. If the investor is allotted shares in part or full, they will receive a Confirmatory Allotment Note (CAN). Such a note will be issued within six working days after the closure of the IPO process. The allotted shares will be credited to the Demat account of the investor and will be available for trading once they are listed on the stock exchange.Watch this video on YouTubeWhat are the prerequisites to invest in an IPO? Investors can use IPOs as a good way to build their investment portfolios.
