This is mainly to ensure uniformity across the investment universe, especially for equity mutual funds. As per SEBI guidelines, AMFI in partnership with the stock exchanges, comes up with a list of stocks classified into different categories as per their market capitalisation. AMFI’s stock re-categorisation does not directly result in any fresh inflows or outflows for mutual funds. For any actively managed equity mutual fund, the fund manager is responsible for adding or removing or modifying weightages of stocks in the portfolio. Stocks that have moved up from a lower market-cap categorization to a higher one will start getting more visibility among mutual fund schemes. Fund managers generally analyze such stocks and may consider adding them to the portfolio as per their analysis and scheme objective.ConclusionAfter AMFI’s announcement, mutual funds will likely recalibrate scheme portfolios. Especially for equity oriented schemes, the market cap classification plays a crucial role and these will have to re-align the portfolio at the earliest. Therefore, mutual fund investors must carefully go through the portfolio composition changes to better understand scheme returns.FAQs1.
