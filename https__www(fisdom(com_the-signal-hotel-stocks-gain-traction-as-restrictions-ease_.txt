This expansion of international hotel chains is driven by asset light model where they only manage hotels. Whereas Indian hotel chains are more focused on owning and operating. International hotel companies are dominators in luxury hotel space. However local hotel players have started adopting franchise and management contract models as a growth model that is giving them a strong competitive advantage over international hotel chains.Demand is set to outpace supply: Leaving behind pandemic blues, hoteliers are now more focused on expansion in 2022. Based on research done by hospitality consultancy Hotelivate, about 59,000 rooms are set to hit the market in the next fiver years. Out of this 72 percent that is 35,000 rooms are currently under active development. The active development ratio has gone up by 10 percent as compared to pandemic year 2020.It is estimated that currently there are about 1.5 lakh hotel rooms, in addition there is a projected supply of 35,000 coming (which is being actively developed) in next 5 years, 7,000 rooms are set to hit the market every year, that comes to around 4.5 percent growth in supply. This indicates that demand is certainly set to outpace supply in the upcoming years.Here is a breakup of Branded Hotel opening in Q2FY23:Expansion plans announced by domestic and international hotel chains:Government Initiatives: The government of India in the past few years have undertaken many initiatives to provide enough impetus on tourism industry. This was done by launching cleanliness drive, providing better air connectivity and overall improvement in hospitality sector.
