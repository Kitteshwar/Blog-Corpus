Cryptocurrencies are divided into asset categories such as utility tokens, platform coins, yield farming tokens, storage coins, etc. and the portfolio will consist of investment according to these categories. Thereafter, the asset number or quantity is decided and the asset weighting is done to finalise upon the investment.Selection Investing In this method, the investor expends a lot of time handpicking his or her portfolio elements after doing extensive research. This places the entire responsibility on the investor itself and is seen as an empowering exercise by many.Strategies that Can be Used in CryptocurrencyAll cryptocurrency investors can invest in these currencies following either of the 4 strategies mentioned below – Rupee cost averaging It refers to a systematic investment planning form of buying cryptocurrencies i.e. buying a fixed quantity of cryptocurrency at regular intervals. It is useful for those investors who wish to invest with little effort and have it all automated.Balanced portfolioThis strategy involves the investor buying the same rupee amount of the currency that he or she is investing in. This offers a good chance at diversification.Unbalanced portfolioThis strategy involves the investor buying or investing different amounts in each currency based on how well the currency might perform in the future. This strategy suits investors who have done extensive research about each of the currencies and have a fairly good idea about its past performance and potential performance in the future. This must be resorted to only if one is reasonably sure of his or her investment.Profit reinvestingThis is resorted to when the investor is already reaping profits out of a basket of currencies and wishes to branch out to other currencies – new, promising players in this emerging market. It is useful for those who are sceptical and will trust the investment after trying it out for themselves and reaping profits.Points to Keep in Mind Before Investing in CryptocurrenciesCryptocurrencies are highly volatile and come with a lot of risk currently.
