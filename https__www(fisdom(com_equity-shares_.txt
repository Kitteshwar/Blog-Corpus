AkshathaSajumonWritten by - Akshatha SajumonFebruary 7, 2022  6 minutes  Equity shares are one of the most preferred and widely traded securities in India. An equity share or a stock is a small portion of a company that an investor purchases with an objective to fetch profits. By owning a stock, an investor becomes a shareholder of a company. The investor thereby has a share in the company’s profits or losses.Each equity shareholder has voting rights, using which he/she can vote in any major decision making of the company. Apart from gaining profits due to rise in the share value, equity shareholders can also get dividend payments from the company. Generally, large-sized and well-established companies tend to pay dividends and bonuses due to the availability of more assets at hand. Thus, even if an investor buys 1 share of a company, he/she gets a share in the company’s profits or losses, along with voting rights.
