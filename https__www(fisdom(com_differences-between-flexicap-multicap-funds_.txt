How Flexicap and Multicap Funds WorkMeaning of multicap fundsMulticap funds can invest 65% of their total assets across large, mid, and small-cap stocks. SEBI has mandated that these funds should invest minimum 25% of their portfolio in each of large, mid, and small-cap categories. However, fund managers of these funds may not have an opportunity to completely cut out the exposure to a particular category that may be expected to perform poorly.Benefits of multicap fundsSome of the noteworthy benefits of this fund type are:Multi-cap funds offer the flexibility to invest in equities as per the investor’s objectives, irrespective of market capitalization. These offer better opportunities for diversification across various sectors, especially when it comes to fast-growing industries which may not have large-cap companies.Fund managers can dynamically change the portfolio mix as per market conditions based on risks and opportunities. Thus, these are ideal for investors who do not have the expertise or capacity to closely monitor market movements for frequently making portfolio changes.Meaning of Flexicap fundsThese funds were introduced in November 2020 as per SEBI circular. Flexicap funds invest at least 65% of their total assets in equity investments with no fixed limits on the exposure to large, mid, or small-cap segments. Unlike multi-cap funds, Flexicap fund managers have the liberty to change their allocation across large, mid, and small-cap categories. Benefits of Flexicap fundsSome of the key benefits of these funds are:Flexi cap fund managers can invest across various market capitalizations.These funds adopt a well-diversified equity strategy. These are better placed to capitalize on opportunities available in different market spectrums irrespective of sector or style. With a diverse portfolio, it balances the risk and return components well.How are Multicap and Flexicap funds different?The table below shows the main differentiating points of multi-cap and Flexi Cap funds:ParameterFlexi-cap fundsMulti-cap fundsEquity exposureMinimum 65%Minimum 65%Allocation across market capsNot fixed, fund managers can decide percentage allocation to different market caps.Minimum 25% in each large, mid, and small-cap as mandated by SEBI.Flexibility Higher flexibility in determining asset allocation as per market trends.Limited flexibility to fund managers. They must ensure minimum exposure across all capitalisation is maintained at minimum 25%.SuitabilityIdeal for conversative investors. May suit aggressive investors.Historical performanceSince this fund category was introduced recently, investors may be unable to track historical performance of the selected fund.Investors can go through the historical performance, however, it may offer limited perspective due to modified SEBI mandate on percentage of allocation.Investment horizonSuited for a 5 year investment horizon since these involve strategic allocation across market caps.Ideal for a 5-7 year investment horizon due to comparatively higher mid-cap and small-cap exposure.Which fund should an investor select – multi-cap or flexicap?Both multi-cap and Flexicap funds have certain SEBI mandates to be followed. Therefore, each adopts unique strategies to cater to investors with different risk profiles and return expectations.While the multi-cap category allows fund managers to use their stock-picking skills, the mandatory percentage exposure across capitalisations poses a risk. This is because of limited scope available to fund managers in reducing exposure to a particular market cap expected to perform poorly in the future. Thus, the AMC is responsible to have appropriate framework in dealing with liquidity and risk challenges arising from small-cap investments. Investors who are comfortable with a fixed allocation across capitalisations and have a higher risk appetite can invest in multi-cap funds. Investors must have a longer investment horizon to see maximum benefits from these funds.Flexi-cap funds are not mandated to have a fixed minimum allocation across market capitalisation. This allows fund managers to use their conviction and skills in determining the right allocation. After evaluating the growth potential offered by different companies and irrespective of the market cap, a fund manager can freely invest in selected stocks. Fund managers, in this case, can track market segment performance and switch the allocation to an alternative market segment expected to perform well.Taxation of Flexicap and Multicap FundsThe long-term capital gains (LTCG) tax on equity-oriented mutual funds is 10% on gains above Rs. 1 lakh per financial year. Short-term capital gains (STCG) tax on equity-oriented mutual funds is 15%. This applies to Flexicap and Multicap funds as well.For example, if you invest Rs. 1 lakh in a Flexicap or Multicap fund and sell it after two years for Rs. 1.5 lakhs, then the LTCG tax will be applicable on the Rs. 50,000 gain above Rs. 1 lakh. The LTCG tax will be 10% of Rs. 50,000 which is Rs. 5,000.When to invest in Flexicap and Multicap FundsThe best time to invest in Flexicap and Multicap Funds depends on various factors such as market conditions, economic indicators, and the performance of the funds. It is important to note that these funds are subject to market risks and investors should consult with a financial advisor before investing.However, when you invest in a multi/flexi cap fund consider schemes based on its respective market cap allocation after assessing your own risk appetite to avoid taking undue risk.Conclusion – Understanding the differences and making the right choice between Flexicap and Multicap fundsSEBI has intentionally set up different mutual fund categories to offer higher clarity to investors and allow them to make informed investment decisions. Investors may have different risk appetites, knowledge of the markets, return expectations, etc. While selecting between multicap and Flexicap funds, investors must consider these factors to accordingly make an investment decision. FAQsHow to invest in multi-cap and Flexicap funds?To explore options in multi-cap and Flexicap funds, you can download the Fisdom  app on your smartphone.
