Debt funds, on the other hand, are known to limit the risk factor and provide more or less stable returns. But what if investors can get the best of both types of funds where they can maximize their returns at the same time limit their exposure too. What are balanced hybrid funds and how do they work?Balanced funds are a suitable answer or a solution for investors looking for the high earning potential of equity funds and the limited exposure of the debt funds. Balanced funds are classified under hybrid funds and provide the benefit of wealth-building from the equity portion of the fund and provide capital protection from the debt portion of the fund. Hybrid funds invest approximately 40% to 60% in equity and equity-related instruments and the balance is invested in debt and debt-related instruments. Where the investment is higher in equity, such a fund is known as an equity-oriented hybrid fund. Similarly, where the dominant investment is in debt, such a fund is known as a debt-oriented fund. What is the purpose of balanced hybrid funds?Balanced hybrid funds are mutual funds that invest in both equity and debt instruments. The purpose of these funds is to provide investors with a balanced portfolio that can generate returns from both equity and debt markets. These funds are ideal for investors who want to invest in both equity and debt markets but do not have the time or expertise to manage their investments actively. The allocation between equity and debt instruments is decided by the fund manager based on market conditions and the fund’s investment objectives.Who are the target investors for balanced hybrid funds?These funds provide the benefits of equity funds as well as debt funds. The idea of the balanced funds is to invest more or less in equal proportion on each of the asset classes to ensure that the investors are protected against the capital erosion which is a risk in the equity funds as well as get high returns which are usually not possible in debt funds. These funds are ideal for novice or new and young investors who are starting in the mutual fund market and may want to limit their exposure and at the same time earn higher returns than traditional investment options.The fund managers of the balanced hybrid funds aim to create a portfolio with a balance of risk and return expectations of the dynamic and aggressive as well as risk-averse investors.  Hence, these funds are ideal for moderately conservative investors.What are the pros and cons of balanced hybrid funds?Balanced hybrid funds have a host of benefits and limitations that have to be thoroughly understood by investors before making an investment decision. Some of the pros and cons of these funds that can help investors understand these funds better are mentioned below.ProsThe advantages of investing in balanced hybrid funds are DiversificationThe prime benefit of Balanced hybrid funds is diversification. Investors can get the benefit of equity funds as well as debt funds under a single Mutual Fund. This diversification provides the investors with the best of both worlds by limiting the risk involved.Reduced investment costAnother added advantage of investing in balanced hybrid funds is the reduced cost of investment. Investors do not have to invest in multiple funds of different asset classes to gain the advantages of each of the funds.  they can simply choose a balanced hybrid fund and thereby cost of investment by almost half.  This reduced expense ratio will reflect eventually higher returns ultimately benefiting the investors. Better returnsBalanced hybrid funds have the advantage of the equity component of the funds which translates to better returns as compared to plain vanilla debt funds. The returns are inflation-adjusted returns which is not usually the case with traditional investment options like bank deposits or other government savings schemes like PPF, SCSS,, etc. Limited risk exposureInvestors have the benefit of limiting their exposure to the volatility of the market due to the debt portion in the fund. The debt portion also provides a sense of stability in the fund performance. ConsLet us now discuss the various risks associated with balanced funds.

Some of such risks are mentioned below.Credit risk is the risk of default at the time of maturityInterest rate risk which arises on account of interest rate fluctuations Reinvestment risk is the risk of investment at a lower interest rate than the previous or initial investment.Liquidity risk is the risk that the fund house may not be in a position to redeem the investment at the time of maturity.Volatility risks are associated with equity funds as they are highly volatile to market fluctuations. Market risks are the risk of losses on account of price fluctuations or other factors affecting the performance of the fund.Concentration risk is the risk of loss of investment due to increased exposure or unfavourable turn of events leading to losses for the investors. How are balance hybrid funds taxed?Balanced funds are a combination of equity and debt instruments. Hence, the taxation of these funds depends on the dominant investment class in the fund.
