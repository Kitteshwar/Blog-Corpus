This is expected to add close to 500 million fresh internet users, thereby creating multiple opportunities for business in this sector.Close to US$20 billion of investment is being made by Indian telecom majors toward network and operations expansion. This is a strong boost for the sector.Finnish telecommunication major Nokia will have a tie-up with Indian telcos Bharti Airtel and BSNL to design a roadmap for achieving a conducive ecosystem for 5G technology in the country.The Government of India is taking various initiatives to ensure digital connectivity for rural and remote parts of the country. To aid this objective, it will introduce an affordable tariff structure based on ‘lesser pay for more usage’. These changes are already seen in tariff structures being introduced by service providers across the country.Four telecom majors, including Adani Group, Airtel, Jio, and Vodafone Idea are going to participate in India’s first 5G auction starting July 26. With the 5G spectrum auction, the sector will see a new scale of competition and a wider user base in the future.5G spectrum auction – the competition beginsThe 5G spectrum auction that will begin shortly is being made available for commercial networks as well as private networks. The latest one to tap onto this opportunity is Adani group which intends to use the 5G spectrum for building a private network. India’s richest man, Gautam Adani’s Adani group will be one of the participants in the auction for 5G telecom spectrum. Although the company said that it does not intend to participate in consumer mobility space, experts are indicating a strong possibility that the company may enter the same in the long run. This means, tough competition lies ahead of Airtel, Reliance Jio, and Vodafone-Idea. While Jio and Airtel can withstand competition due to strong balance sheets, experts indicate tough times ahead for Vodafone-Idea.Watch this video on YouTubeHindrances in telecom sector growthSome of the hurdles in the growth journey of this sector are:Poor financial health: Due to the pressure of lower tariffs, telecom majors are facing lowered y-o-y gross revenues. There is a visibly rapid decline in ARPU (Average Revenue per User). Many telcos are also facing losses and fast-falling profits that are weakening the financial health of the overall sector.Lack of innovation: There is an observed lack of innovation in this sector combined with a delayed deployment of innovative offerings. This is primarily attributed to unfavourable government policies and regulations.Slower broadband penetration is another factor that is resulting in slower overall growth in the telecom sector. Currently, India has a broadband penetration of only 7%. Further, the semi-rural and rural areas are not fully covered by major telcos due to the high fixed costs involved.The state governments charged substantial Right-of-Way (ROW) costs to telcos for laying of fibres. This directly impacts the company’s bottom lines.5G cost vs benefits: Telcos bidding for the 5G spectrum auction had requested for a 95% reduction in base price set by TRAI. However, the discount being offered is only upto 40%. In all, the bidders will be shelling out Rs. 1 lakh crores in the auction. This means higher cost for bidders versus the possibility of handset makers not attracting enough customers by only using the 5G sales pitch. Top stocks in the Indian telecom sector on market capitalization basisBharti Airtel LtdBharti Airtel Ltd, is India’s and Asia’s leading telecom services provider.
