These temporary (read as: contingent) and temperament-testing swings on the downside across global and domestic markets, has witnessed wealth  preservation become the flavor of investments, over wealth creation.All major Asset classes have been subject to multiple pain points over the last few years, as can be seen below:– EquityWith VIX levels touching all-time highs in 2020, with no respite in sight, investor wealth has seen massive erosion in the first 6 months of 2020. However, as economies continue to normalize, with green shoots back in place, equities today present attractive entry points to realize long-term healthy gains.– DebtThe IL&FS crisis in late 2017, spelt doom for our shadow-banking industry, a key proponent for helping India achieve the $5 tn economy mark by 2025. The DHFL fraud, further augured feelings of discomfort in the debt industry with MFs not willing to roll debt or issue fresh CDs without adjusted risk premiums. This clearly shows why risk-averse investors should not compromise on credit quality to realize growth, but stick to AAA/AA rated papers, or investigate the likes of “risk-free” Govt. papers.– GoldGold has lived up to its merit of being a safe-haven asset touching all-time levels at Rs. 55,000/10 gm levels. However, this potential may be short-lived, as economies continue to adapt to the new normal. As has been seen before, Gold’s attractiveness as an investment case tends to be weaker during healthy economic periods, in comparison to other asset classes.As can be seen above, an investor overweight on either asset class, can see misalign their portfolio in terms of risk-return metrics.
