This has pushed risk-averse investors towards debt instruments that are considered safer as compared to pure equities. However, with the recent budget changes in the taxation of debt funds, the returns from these instruments are not left as attractive. With the global interest rates on the rise to combat inflation, let us evaluate target maturity funds and fixed maturity funds as suitable investment options for investors.   Table of Contents  hide   1 What are Target Maturity Funds?   2 What are Fixed Maturity Plans?   3 What are the key differences between TMF and FMPs?   4 What is a better investment option between TMF and FMP?   5 Conclusion   6 FAQs Read More: Changes in tax benefits on debt mutual fundsWhat are Target Maturity Funds?Target maturity funds are a type of passive mutual fund that tracks an underlying bond index with a defined maturity date. These funds invest in a basket of bonds, such as government securities or PSU bonds, and hold them until the maturity date. As the bonds in the basket pay regular coupons, the interest is reinvested in the same basket of bonds. At maturity, investors receive the principal amount along with the accrued interest.Target maturity funds can be in the form of ETFs or Index Funds. While ETFs require a Demat and trading account and can be traded like regular ETFs, investors can invest in Index Funds without a Demat account but cannot trade them as in the case of ETFs. One of the benefits of target maturity funds is that they are virtually risk-free and investors can lock in current yields by holding the fund till the maturity date.Some of the top schemes of target maturity funds for 2023 include,Aditya Birla Sun Life Nifty SDL Plus PSU Bond Sep 26 60 40 Fnd (G)Bandhan CRISIL IBX Gilt April 2028 Index fund (G)BHARAT Bond ETF FOF April 2032 (G)Edelweiss NIFTY PSU Bond Plus SDL Apr 2027 50:50 Index – Direct PlanAxis CRISIL IBX SDL May 2027 Index FundKotak Nifty SDL Apr 2032 Top 12 Equal Weight Index FundWhat are Fixed Maturity Plans?Fixed Maturity Plans (FMPs) are mutual funds that invest in fixed-income securities like bonds, certificates of deposit, or commercial paper that have similar maturity dates as the fund. This fund has a diverse maturity date ranging from a few days to years, usually 30 days to 5 years. These are close-ended funds with a fixed return on investment, which is known upfront to the investor. Any changes in the interest rates do not have an effect on the returns from the fund. This makes them a less volatile or low-risk investment option as compared to other types of mutual funds, which may have to sell their securities before maturity to meet investor redemptions.Investors who invest in FMPs need to keep their money invested for the entire tenure of the fund. This means that they cannot withdraw their investment before the maturity date of the FMP. However, if investors wish to exit the FMP before maturity, they can sell their units on the stock exchange to another investor through their demat account. The price at which they sell the units will depend on the prevailing market conditions.What are the key differences between TMF and FMPs? Target Maturity Funds (TMFs) and Fixed Maturity Plans (FMPs) are types of mutual funds that invest in fixed-income securities.
