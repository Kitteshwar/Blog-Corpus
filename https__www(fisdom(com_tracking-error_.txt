It can be used to measure an investment’s performance, especially in comparing the performance against the benchmark over a specific period. Thus, tracking error is an indicator to understand how well a fund is being managed and the risks involved for investors.In layman’s terms, tracking error is the difference between an investment portfolio’s returns and the index it mirrors. It is a handy measurement of the performance of portfolio managers. It is also known as an active risk for gauging the performance of hedge funds, ETFs, or mutual funds.Let us understand this with the help of an example. Suppose an index has gained 4% in a month. If the index fund that tracks the index has gained 3.5% in the same month, then the monthly tracking error will be the difference, which is 0.5%. Even if the fund returns are 4.5%, the tracking error will be 0.5%.Reasons for tracking errorThere are 3 main reasons why a tracking error may occur in Index Funds. Here’s a look at each of these in detail: Mutual fund expensesMutual funds expenses could include the cost of buying and selling stocks, fund management fees, administration charges, etc which makes up the expense ratio of a mutual fund. The thumb rule is that the higher the expenses, the higher the tracking error. To limit the tracking error arising from higher expenses, fund managers often use many techniques like portfolio rebalancing, managing dividends, using Index Futures, lending securities, and fixed-income investments.   Cash balanceMutual funds usually don’t invest 100% of their assets. Most funds keep aside 2 to 5% of investable assets in cash or parked in highly liquid debt instruments for managing redemptions. An Index Fund may get an inflow of cash in case of a sudden rise in investment or dividend payouts through stocks within the portfolio. In such cases, a fund manager may take a while to reinvest additional money and this can result in an increase in tracking error. Inability to buy or sell underlying stocksTracking errors could also arise due to an index fund’s inability to buy or sell the underlying stocks. This could occur due to low liquidity levels or sudden market movements that trigger volatility in specific stocks. Such situations are often seen in sectoral or thematic funds that have larger tracking errors.Importance of tracking errorHere are some of the pointers indicating the importance of tracking error –It helps in measuring and comparing a portfolio’s performance with the respective benchmark or index.Helps understand the consistency of higher returns.Portfolio managers can use tracking error for ascertaining how close a portfolio is to its benchmark.Using a tracking error, investors can determine how proficient a portfolio manager’s investment strategy is.Limitations of tracking errorInvestors must keep in mind the below-mentioned limitations of tracking error –Tracking error can be used to measure both underperformance and outperformance of a fund against its benchmark. Investors often prefer a high tracking error in case of out-performance on the fund’s part. Alternatively, a low tracking error is preferable in case of consistent underperformance. However, tracking error cannot help in instantly distinguishing between the two.Important points for investorsInvestors can view tracking error as an indicator of how actively a fund is being managed and associated risk levels. Investors who observe the tracking error of a fund over a period to get sufficient insight into the risk control mechanisms implemented by the fund. With the help of tracking error, investors can identify schemes which have avoidable risks like high levels of cash, imbalance in Index weightage, etc.  While choosing an Index fund, it makes sense for investors to pick a fund with a low tracking error even if it is not the lowest among all investment categories. While it is important to look at tracking errors, it is also important to pay attention to the track record of the AMC and the fund. A smart way to select the right index fund is by selecting one that has a strong track record of operating with the lowest tracking error while charging the lowest expense to the fund. While tracking error results in the fund’s performance diverging from that of the index, the expense ratio is a fixed charge on the investment which will anyway chip off at the fund’s performance. Typically, AMCs managing large index funds with a longer track record offer the dual benefit of efficient tracking errors and relatively lower expense ratios.ConclusionAlthough rarely focused upon, tracking errors can have a significant effect on an investor’s returns. Therefore, it is important to consider this aspect of any index fund before investing in it.FAQsWhat is a good tracking error for index funds?An index fund should ideally have a tracking error of zero while matching performance to its benchmark. However, in reality, index funds tend to have tracking errors in the 1%-2% range.Is index fund investment safe in India?Index funds track a market index and are passively managed funds. Therefore, they tend to be less volatile as compared to actively managed equity funds and may have comparatively lower risk levels.How do I choose an index fund in India?To choose the right index fund for investment, investors should consider factors such as historical tracking error trend of the fund, personal risk appetite against fund’s risk levels, and also historical returns generated by the fund.What do different tracking error levels indicate?Low tracking error is an indication that a fund is closely following its benchmark index. High tracking error indicates the opposite. In summary, investors can get a sense of how closely a fund is following its benchmark or how volatile the fund is relative to its benchmark index.What is the difference between tracking error and tracking difference?|Tracking difference measures the difference between an index fund’s returns and the benchmark index. Tracking error is an indicator of the variability between the individual data points that contribute to the fund’s average tracking difference.Other interesting reads4 factors to look out for while choosing a passive fundTrack all your mutual fund investments in one placeIndex funds in India – Top Performing Index Funds in IndiaHow to invest in ETFs?Exchange Traded Funds(ETFs)- What are they and how do they work?Share the article                      Get exclusive content
