A spread is the difference between the price of stock and the price of its futures contract. Arbitrage funds delivers returns from a positive arbitrage spread and gives negative whenever there is negative spread.How future prices converge with the spot priceWhat was the primary reason for such negative spread?If you look at May end series, market-wide rollovers stand at 91% (vs. average rollovers of 86% seen in last 3 series). Stock future rollover stand at 94% (vs. average rollovers of 90% seen in last 3 series). Due to this pressure from arbitrage players over short roll overs, spread across stocks dipped into negative zone from over 20bps. Even the large inflows in last two months and lower interest rates have also contributed to the dip.How do we look at it?Amid such environment we all know that the arbitrage fund may generate lower returns over the next couple of weeks, however one should not forget that the market volatility during the May 2020 helps funds managers capturing better arbitrage opportunities by churning the portfolio in between. Hence, the actual returns are better than the spread captured on expiry days. One should ideally invest in arbitrage funds with at least 3-6 month’s investment horizon for stable investment experience.Key Takeaways:Existing Investor: Nothing will change for existing investor, they should stay invested for a horizon of 3-6 months.For new investor who has time horizon of 3-6 months can definitely look at arbitrage funds cause they may generate better yields compared to liquid funds on a post-tax basis.We believe that in couple of weeks the situation should normalize.[tek_button button_text=”Download Fisdom App” button_link=”url:https%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F3feSNXX||target:%20_blank|” button_position=”button-center”]Join our Fin Insight Community  Mutual Funds  Stocks Vs Equity Mutual Funds – Where Should you Invest? 30 May  5 minutes   Mutual Funds  Understanding CAGR: Compounded Annual Growth Rate Explained 26 May  6 minutes   Mutual Funds  How to Withdraw Money from Mutual Funds: A Guide to Redeeming and Selling Funds Online 26 May  6 minutes   Mutual Funds  Differences between Target Maturity Funds and Fixed Maturity Plans 25 May  6 minutes   Mutual Funds  SEBI Allows Investments in International Funds Again: All You Need to Know 25 May  8 minutes   Mutual Funds  Income Funds – Steady Income Generation with Low to Moderate Risks 14 May  7 minutes   Mutual Funds  Asset Allocation Funds – A Diversified Investment Strategy for Balanced Returns 14 May  6 minutes   Mutual Funds  Flexicap vs Multicap Funds – Understanding the Differences and Making the Right Choice 14 May  7 minutes   Mutual Funds  Credit Risk Funds – Understanding the Risks and Rewards of High-Yield Debt 13 May  8 minutes   Mutual Funds  Active vs. Passive vs. Balanced Funds: Which is Right for You? 13 May  9 minutes   Mutual Funds  Growth Funds – Investing in High-Potential Companies for Long-Term Capital Appreciation 13 May  8 minutes   Mutual Funds  PSU Debt Fund – A Safe Haven for Conservative Investors 13 May  10 minutes
