Following this, taxpayers also have to verify their tax returns within 30 days of filing them. The Income Tax Department will then start the next step of processing the returns. Assessees are then sent out intimations under section 143(1). This intimation order is essentially acceptance by the department of the details that the taxpayers have provided. Once the intimation order is sent, the processing of the ITR begins. The department typically takes about a month to process the returns which involves going through the details submitted and verifying the same with Form 26AS and other avenues. After completing the processing of the returns, the department will either raise the demand for further taxes as per their records or accept the refund request as raised by the taxpayer. The further demand for taxes is to be paid at the earliest, on the other hand, in case of a refund, the same is issued within 60 days of the notice. Also Read: Important points to keep in mind while filing your IT returnWhat can taxpayers do if ITR is not processed?There may also be cases when the assessees have completed the process of filing the returns from their end, filing them within the due dates and e-verifying them within the specified timelines.
