India’s wealth is expected to rise to $18.4 trillion in real terms in 2025, similar to the level in the USA in the mid-1960s. To put icing on the cake, India’s household wealth is set to overtake that of its former colonial ruler (UK) within the next five years.As India gears to take the pedestal amidst peers on the global growth scale, it is also expected to be one of the fastest contenders in trickling down such wealth to those who invest or choose to stay invested.
