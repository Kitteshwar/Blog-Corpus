What are PMS (Portfolio Management Services)?PMS or Portfolio Management Services are a type of investment service that manage various investment formats like stocks, bonds, commodities, or other securities on behalf of investors. Under PMS, investors get customised investment solutions based on their investment goals, risk tolerance, and investment horizon. The portfolio managers use their expertise and thorough research to build investment portfolios and manage assets that are expected to provide returns as per investors’ objectives. PMS usually charges higher fees for providing customised services that can be in the nature of a fixed percentage of AUM or fixed fees and can vary based on the size of the portfolio, customisation needed, or the investment strategy adopted to meet the financial needs. The minimum investment for PMS is generally around Rs. 25,00,000 or higher, depending on the PMS provider’s policies. However, in some cases, PMS providers may also require a minimum investment of Rs. 50,00,000. What are AIFs?AIFs or Alternative Investment Funds are a category of privately pooled investment funds that invest in assets other than traditional investments like stocks, bonds, and cash. AIFs are regulated by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) under the SEBI (Alternative Investment Funds) Regulations, 2012. AIFs mainly invest in assets like private equity, venture capital funds, hedge funds, real estate, infrastructure, and other alternative investments. These funds are capable of providing potentially higher returns but have a higher risk of investment as compared to traditional investment options. SEBI has classified AIFs into three categories and the minimum investment into an AIF is Rs 1,00,00,000 which ultimately limits the entry for retail investors. The categories of AIF as per SEBI are:Category IThese funds are invested in small businesses, start-ups, social ventures, early-stage ventures, angel funds, etc., with superior growth potential and certain tax incentives. These are usually of low-risk grades. Category IIThis category includes investments in Private Equity (PE) funds, Fund of funds, and debt instruments. Any AIFs that do not fall under Category I and III as per SEBI classification are classified in this category. These funds do not undertake leverage or borrowing except for the purpose of meeting day-to-day operational requirements.Category IIIAIFs under this category employ diverse or complex trading strategies that mayemploy leverage, through investment in listed or unlisted derivatives. These are relatively less regulated open-ended or close-ended funds that aim at generating short-term returns by employing diverse and complex trading strategies. Category-III funds can include hedge funds and Private Investment in Public Equity (PIPE) Funds.What are the key differences between PMS and AIFs?PMS and AIFs both aim at providing customised investment solutions to HNIs and investors in India.
