A borrower or credit user may have a score of 900 if his/her credit history is above-par. A high credit score is a reflection of responsible credit behaviour. Here are a few of the ways that a credit user can improve his/her credit score:Repay on timeMissing repayments on any outstanding debt can negatively impact one’s credit score. It is important to be punctual about paying loan EMIs or credit card dues. Delays in paying these could mean penalties and also impact on credit score. Setting reminders for timely payments is a smart step towards ensuring a good credit score.Maintain a healthy credit mixA good mix of secured (loans like home, vehicle loans) and unsecured loans (personal loans & credit cards) reflecting on a borrower’s credit report is preferred by lenders. This also improves credit score of a borrower. Avoid multiple loans at onceAnyone who is aiming for a good credit score must ensure that existing loans or dues are paid off before taking another one. Multiple loans if taken at the same time reflect financial issues on the part of the borrower. Therefore, it makes sense to take one loan at a time and pay it in its entirety to improve credit score. Your loan EMIs should not take up more than 40-50% of your take home salary. Lower credit utilizationSpending 30% of the available monthly credit limit on credit cards is an effective way to maintain a lower credit utilisation and ensuring a good credit score. Spending more than 30% of the credit limit indicates that a credit user spends without a second thought and results in a drop in credit score.ConclusionA good credit score can mean monetary savings and multiple other benefits, like easy availability of credit at favourable terms and conditions. As banks and lenders continue to focus on credit scores to gauge creditworthiness of borrowers, borrowers need to place higher importance on maintaining a good score at all times.
