It gives investors voting rights towards corporate policy decisions and also the right to choose a company’s board of directors. Common stocks, also known as common shares, can fetch faster returns for investors. Common shareholders also enjoy the right to claim a company’s assets in case of its liquidation after paying to preferred shareholders, bondholders, and other creditors in full. One can purchase common stocks through a company’s initial public offering (IPO). Common stocks are reported in a company’s balance sheet under the stockholder equity section. By subtracting the total number of treasury stocks from the total shares issued, one can arrive at the number of stocks offered by a company.

This is an important factor to consider since common shareholders do not receive priority payouts even if a company performs extremely well.UncertaintyAlthough common shareholding may be considered as a fixed-income alternative, there is no guarantee of returns.

Common stockholders are paid dividends before the preferred shareholders only if the company makes substantial earnings.If a company is liquidated, preferred shareholders get their share before common shareholders. Common stockholders can get their due only if there are assets remaining after all other shareholders have been paid.ParametersPreferred stockCommon stockVoting rightsNoYesDividend payoutFixed at a pre-defined intervalVariable depending on management’s decisionVolatilityLowHighSubcategoriesYesNoRisk and returnsLowHighConclusionSome of the common stocks, such as blue-chip stocks, offer stability and security to investors, whereas others like penny stocks are often extremely volatile.
