The fact that Mutual Funds are subjected to market conditions, makes investors so skeptical regarding investments with Mutual Funds. Fearing market volatility and safety of funds, investors find it safer to invest in Fixed Deposits rather than in Mutual Funds. But to overcome this conventional practice, it’s important for us investors to understand why and how Mutual Fund investments are a better option than Fixed Deposit and this article will help with that.
