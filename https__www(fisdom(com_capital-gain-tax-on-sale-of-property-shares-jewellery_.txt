Therefore, it is important to be aware of tax implications on the gain/loss from the sale of such assets. Tax liability on the sale of these assets depends on the holding period and is calculated under the head ‘Capital Gains’.The tax chargeable on the gains made from the sale of capital assets is called capital gains tax. Capital gains tax can be long-term (LTCG) or short-term (STCG), depending on the holding period of the asset. Currently, LTCG is 10% for stocks and equity mutual funds whereas 20% with indexation for real estate, debt mutual funds, and other assets.   Table of Contents  hide   1 What are capital gains?   2 What are capital assets?   3 Calculation of tax on short term and long term gain from sale of Property, Shares & jewellery   4 Conclusion   5 FAQs What are capital gains?Profit or gain arising from the sale of assets such as property, gold jewelry or stocks is known as capital gains. Capital Gains can be further divided into two categories:Long-term capital gainIf, for example, an individual sells his/her house after  36 months from the date of its acquisition, the profits arising from the sale are known as LTCG. This holding period of 36 months differs across capital assets. For equities and equity mutual funds the holding period is 12 months, whereas for immovable assets like house property, land, etc it is 24 months. Short-term capital gainIf an asset is sold within 36 months from its acquisition, then the gain arising from it is called a short-term capital gain (STCG). For example, if an individual sells a house within 24 months from the date of acquisition, then profits from it fall under STCG. The long-term and short-term capital gain classification is different when it comes to shares/mutual funds. For listed shares and equity-oriented mutual funds, a long-term capital gain arises if these are sold ‘after’ a holding period of one year and short-term capital gain is considered if the assets are sold ‘within’ one year.What are capital assets?A capital asset can be land, building, vehicle, residential property, patents, trademarks, machinery, leasehold rights, and also jewelry.

If, for example, the short-term capital gain is Rs. 10 lakhs and the person falls under the 30% income tax bracket, then he/she must pay 31.20% on Rs. 10 lakhs, i.e. Rs 3,12,000.

It increases the cost and reduces gains such that overall tax liability is reduced. Long-term capital gains/losses have the benefit of indexation. An individual having long-term capital gains/losses and falling within the tax bracket of 30% also gets an advantage of a lower tax rate of 20%. Long-term capital gains are calculated in the same manner as short-term capital gains. However, in long-term capital gains, the purchase cost of the asset and cost of the improvement is replaced with the indexed cost of acquisition and indexed cost of the improvement.Long Term Capital Gain = Sale consideration—The indexed cost of acquisition—The indexed cost of improvement—Expenses incurred exclusively for the sale of the Asset—Exemption u/s 54, 54F, 54EC if any availed.Indexed cost can be calculated using the following formula:Indexed Cost of acquisition = Cost of acquisition * Cost Inflation Index of the year of saleIndexed Cost of Improvement=Cost of improvement * Cost Inflation Index of the year in which improvement took placeAs per Section 54 of the IncomeTax Act, an individual or HUF while selling a residential property can avail tax exemptions from capital gains if the same is invested towards the purchase or construction of the residential property.Capital gains calculation on Sale of sharesShort term capital gains tax Short-term capital gain on listed shares/equity-oriented mutual funds (if sold within one year from acquisition) will be taxable at 15.60% (including health and education cess).
