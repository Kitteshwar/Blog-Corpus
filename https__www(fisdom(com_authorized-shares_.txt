When a company is started, the management has to decide the maximum number of shares that can be allowed to be issued in any form even before the incorporation of the company. This number includes the minimum number of shares that are to be issued to the founders along with the stock that is to be issued to the general public as well as any additional stock that is to be promised or issued in the future.Let us consider the following example to understand the concept of Authorized Shares in a better manner. Company A has Authorized Shares of Rs. 1,00,00,000. Therefore, the maximum number of shares that can be issued by Company A is up to Rs. 1,00,00,000. If the issued capital in the given case is Rs. 80,00,000, the company can further issue shares worth Rs. 20,00,000. The issued capital in such a case will be equal to the Authorized capital. However, if the company has issued shares worth Rs. 1,50,00,00, it is way beyond the maximum limit allowed as per the Authorized shares. Hence, in this case, the company will not be allowed to issue shares beyond the limit under Authorized shares of the company. If the company wishes to issue more shares beyond the Authorized Shares, they will have to increase the limit of Authorized shares via the prescribed process.What is the ideal number of authorized shares for any company?Authorized shares are the maximum ceiling beyond which a company cannot issue shares to the general public or to their employees or founders. This amount of authorized shares is mentioned under the Memorandum of Association under the heading ‘Capital Clause’ as well as in the balance sheet under the head ‘Share Capital’. The ideal number of Authorized Shares for any company is not standard. It depends on various factors like the nature of the industry (whether it is capital intensive or service-oriented), the scale of operations, target customers, etc. A company should ensure that the maximum number of Authorized Shares are enough to meet the current requirements of the company in terms of promotor’s shares, shares to be issued to the general public as well as for employees in the form of ESOPs.
