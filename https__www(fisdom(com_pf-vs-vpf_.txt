With provident fund (PF) you have to mandatorily invest 12% of your salary while with Voluntary Provident Fund (VPF) the contributions you make are voluntary.Many previous studies and experts claim that Voluntary Provident Fund (VPF) is a better option of investment. Through this article we will take a brief look at both PF and VPF, focusing more on VPF and why you should opt for VPF investment.What is a Provident Fund (PF)?Provident Fund (PF) is a savings scheme for salaried employees. Every month a part of the employee’s salary goes into the Provident Fund which is given to the employee either at the time of retirement or when they exit the employment.You are not required to pay any tax on this Provident Fund if you withdraw the Provident Fund amount after more than 5 years of employment. Provident Fund is also a great way to save a good amount of your money through your earning years which can be then either withdrawn or invested to gain more returns after your retirement.One of the biggest benefits of investing in a PF is that you can earn monthly interest which is compounded and grows into a bigger sum for your post-retirement income. This helps a great deal to secure your post retirement life and to meet your further financial goals.What is a Voluntary Provident Fund (VPF)?Voluntary Provident Fund (VPF) is an extended version of the Employees Provident Fund (EPF). Through a voluntary Provident Fund your contributions as an employee to your PF accounts are voluntary and can be more than the 12% that are made through the Employees’ Provident Fund scheme. The percentage of contributions made through the Voluntary Provident Fund (VPF) is not decided and depends on your choice with the maximum contribution being 100% of your salary with dearness allowance. Neither the employer nor the employee is under any obligation to make contributions to the VPF account.The interest on your VPF account is similar to that offered on your provident fund. As of 2021, the interest is 8.5%. Once you make a contribution to the VPF account, it will be the same for 5 years which is the tenure period for the voluntary provident fund account.As we discussed above, VPF is an extension to EPF so the contributions are deposited in the same amounts. This means the lock in period for both these accounts is the same.VPF interest rates 2023The table below shows interest rate applicable on VPF as of 2023:Interest rate8.1%TenureMaximum up to retirement or resignationInvestment amountFlexible as per employee’s preferenceMaturity valueAs per the investment madeWhy should you opt for VPF?When you invest in VPF, you can invest as much of your money through a single scheme which is risk free and safe to secure your finances and your post retirement life.

This means when you switch jobs, this account can be easily transferred from one employer to another.Voluntary Provident Fund offers you higher returns at a rate as high as 8.5% per annum.
