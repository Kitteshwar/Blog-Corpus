Here’s how to secure your financial future NarenWritten by - NarenApril 5, 2017  4 minutes  According to the great playwright Shakespeare, life is a stage where each one of us plays seven roles depending on our age. This philosophy of Shakespeare finds its application even in our financial planning process. Experts believe that our finances should be planned depending on our life stage. Though there are various investment avenues available in the market, their suitability depends on your requirements which in turn depend on your life stage. When you are unmarried you have almost no responsibilities. After marriage, when you start your own family, your responsibilities multiply. Even without children you have responsibilities. If your spouse is not earning, you have to shoulder all the financial responsibilities. But what if your spouse is earning?Double Income No Kids (DINK) depicts the situation when both spouses are earning and they have no kids. Here are two of the most important features of couples in the DINK category –They have a high disposable income Disposable income is actually the in hand salary received. Since there are two sources of income, DINK couples have a high disposable income. They, thus, have a high investment potential and can invest in a variety of avenues.They have low responsibility Since a child is not in the picture, these couples do not have to plan for their children’s financial safety. As such, their responsibilities and liabilities are low.Do you too fall in the DINK category? If yes, do you know how to plan your investments?With a high disposable income and a variety of investment choices, making a financial plan seems confusing. Does it not? Worry not! Here is a guide for you to chalk out a good investment plan:Create a contingency fund This should actually be the first item in your financial portfolio. A contingency fund is required for those rainy days when you need finance. For instance, either one of you can face unemployment. In that case you would require funds to maintain your lifestyle, wouldn’t you? Or you might face a financial crisis and need funds to come out of it. Whatever be the contingency, the bottom line is that you should have a sufficient contingency fund. Ideally, a life insurance policy and a fund equal to six months’ wages should be set aside for contingency.Buy health insurance Another important requirement is a health insurance plan. The rising incidence of diseases and the inflating medical costs necessitate a health insurance policy. Otherwise, despite the high disposable income, your finances suffer a threat in case of a medical contingency.Get equity exposureEquity investment, though fraught with risks, yields attractive returns. Since you have no kids at present, you can easily afford to take risks. Ensure that at least 60% of your investment portfolio has equity exposure. Invest in equity shares directly or go for mutual fund schemes. Whatever you do, get equity exposure and grow your savings.Start retirement planning Surprised, are you? You must be thinking why retirement planning when you are so young. Well, if you want to build a substantial retirement corpus, the trick is to start young. By putting aside a little amount from a younger age, you let the power of compounding work wonders to your investments and create a considerable corpus. When you have kids, your financial priorities would change. You would have to provide for the child’s financial safety. At that time, investing in a retirement fund would be the last thing on your mind. If you, however, start now, with small amounts, you can continue your investments till you retire and get a good corpus. If you don’t believe me, look at the numbers. Rs.5000 invested monthly towards retirement for 35 years (considering you are presently aged 30 years) at a very conservative interest rate of 8% would yield a corpus of Rs.1.15 crores (approximately). Doesn’t planning young have its benefits?Create assets Buy a car and a home. Due to double earnings, paying off the home loan would be easier. While you would afford your home loan repayments, you would also create an asset for yourself.The DINK stage is a very beneficial stage as you have little or no responsibilities and the income earned is also high. Plan your finances properly and you would never face problems later when you have children, start your family and shoulder greater responsibilities.[tek_button button_text=”Download Fisdom App” button_link=”url:https%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F32lwxsd||target:%20_blank|” button_position=”button-center”]Join our Fin Insight Community  Financial Planning  AI tools for personal finance advice- can you rely on them? 22 May  8 minutes   Financial Planning  Portfolio Rebalancing – What is it?
