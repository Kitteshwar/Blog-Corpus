These funds are carefully formulated to provide the investor with maximum returns on their investment. While selecting a fund for investment, the investor needs to consider many factors, one of which is the category of funds. There are three broad categories of companies that mutual funds invest in namely, large-cap funds, mid-cap funds, and small-cap funds. Investors can select a suitable investment product depending on their risk appetite, return expectations, amount of investment that they can make, etc. Given below are the details of the mid-cap funds and the best mid-cap funds for investment today.What are midcap funds?Mid-cap funds are equity mutual funds that invest a minimum of 65% of their assets in companies that have medium market capitalization. These are ranked from 101st to 250th in terms of market capitalization. Investment in mid-cap companies is a high-risk high-return scenario. These companies have the potential to perform better than the large-cap companies in the time of a bullish market. However, during a bearish market, these investments fall hard.Things to keep in mind about midcap fundsThere are many risks associated with an investment in mid-cap funds. Investors need to have thorough market research and analysis before investing in mid-cap funds. The details of some of the risks associated with mid-caps are mentioned below,Inherent riskWhile investment in mid-cap funds is fruitful in long term, mid-cap companies can potentially take a huge hit during bearish times. This is on account of such companies having a low customer base and relatively fewer resources to sustain a heavy economic slowdown. Although the fund managers take due care before investing in any mid-cap company, there is always a high inherent risk that cannot be completely evaded. LiquidityLiquidity in any fund is of key importance and it also affects fund returns. Mis caps have relatively fewer shares in the market which makes it difficult to make an immediate exit.Market fluctuationsMid-cap funds are prone to high volatility at the time of market fluctuations. The fluctuations of the market can lead to a huge decline in mid-cap funds which may not happen in large-cap funds. Top midcap funds to invest in 2023Axis Midcap Fund GrowthAbout the FundAxis Midcap Fund Growth invests in mid cap companies that have the potential to provide higher returns based on their growth trajectory.
