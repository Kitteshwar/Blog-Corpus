FisdomResearchWritten by - Fisdom ResearchJanuary 21, 2022  3 minutes  As the third wave of the Covid 19 pandemic, the emergence of the Omicron variant, sweeps the country, the Finance Minister has to present a budget in a completely unpredictable environment.While the latest data reflects inflation rose by 5.59 percent in December 2021, against that, the growth in industrial output has slipped 1.4 percent in November, the lowest in nine months. However, a silver lining is that the ongoing pandemic wave has not been seen as severe as the previous ones, allowing the government to continue its focus on pushing growth and boosting investment. Even the tax revenues so far this year have been robust and are expected to surpass the Budget estimates of FY22.Investors will try and gauge things that would and would not impact the stock markets and their portfolios within this unpredictable environment. The relationship between markets and Budget is more an appearance than an image. Markets treat Budget as just another event; at least market returns depict the same.

This time around, the short-term effect of the budget is paired with uncertainty around inflation and rising interest rates across the globe and a move towards normalization hence inducing volatility over the past few months.Have a look at the nifty performance over the long term:In the long run, markets have maintained their return slope to be upward sloping. This curve is inclusive of the budget and more.
