But here is the benefit that the government of India has allowed investors to avail so the government says or rather the Income Tax department says 3 years back Dal would have cost you a Rs.100 but now it is costing you a Rs.150 because of inflation so your real gain from 100 is not to 180 because money at the end of the day is nothing but purchasing power so when dal went up from 100 to 150 and your investment went up from 100 to 180 the Rs.50 of that gain portion can be attributed as an inflation component so gains only over and above the inflation that is 180-100-50=Rs30 would be subject to a tax of 20% thats is Rs.6 so here is a brief overview of how indexation works the calculation is obviously a topic for another day it has quite a lot of metrics into place.Share the article                      Get exclusive content
