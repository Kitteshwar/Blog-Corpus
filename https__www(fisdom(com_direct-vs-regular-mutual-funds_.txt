In this case, the AMC does not have to pay any commission to the fund house for an investment of the investors in their products. The name of the mutual funds specifically mentions the word ‘Direct’ to ensure that the investors can identify such plans as direct plans. These funds have separate NAVs and have a lower expense ratio as compared to regular plans.Meaning of Regular mutual funds Regular mutual funds are another category that can be bought through a broker registered, advisor, or distributor. The AMC has to pay a commission to such middlemen for every new investment by an investor. The expense ratio of such funds is higher than direct mutual funds. Regular mutual funds allow the investors to benefit from having professional fund managers’ expertise to manage their portfolios. This allows even novice investors to be part of mutual funds and thus get the benefits of the investment and eventually increase their wealth.Basic differences between direct and regular mutual fundsApart from the fund manager expertise, there are few basic differences between the two types of mutual funds mentioned above. Some of such differences are highlighted below.Expense ratioThe expense ratio of regular mutual funds includes various expenses like commission or charges of the intermediary (broker, advisor, etc.) This makes the expense ratio a bit on the higher side in the case of regular mutual funds as compared to direct mutual funds. ReturnsThe returns of direct plans are usually higher than the regular plans as they have comparatively a lower expense ratio. Target investorsThe target investors of regular funds are investors who may not have a thorough market knowledge or expertise or even time to gain such knowledge. They rely on investment advisors or agents to manage their portfolios and generate higher returns.But with app-based platforms like Fisdom , you may be able to make effective investment decisions on your own as you get research-backed sound fund recommendations that are suited to your requirements and risk tolerance.Analysis of fundsThe differences between direct and regular mutual plans can be better understood by analyzing the following funds.ICICI Pru BluechipICICI Prudential Bluechip Fund is one of the prime mutual funds offered by ICICI Prudential Mutual Funds.
