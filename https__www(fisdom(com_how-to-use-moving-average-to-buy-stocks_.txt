These are used to decide on stock buying and selling. It is called so since the time frame that we can use for making decisions can be moved. There is a 5-day moving average, 50-day moving average, or even one with a 20-minute time frame.Moving averages are used as part of technical analysis to help an investor smoothen the stock price trend by taking off the daily price movements to make an informed and calculated decision.Different types of moving averages used in stock analysisWhen it comes to stock analysis, there are mainly three types of moving averages:Simple moving average/SMA:A simple moving average requires the average price of a stock across different timelines. It primarily uses closing prices of stocks. As a first step, it requires one to estimate the average prices of a stock as of given time periods. The next step is to divide the sum of prices by the total number of time periods. Let’s understand this with the help of an example:Suppose Nisha wants to know the simple moving average for Stock ‘A’. For this, she considers the closing prices of the stock for the past 5 days.The closing prices are Rs. 25, Rs. 26, Rs. 23, Rs. 24.9 and Rs. 25.3The SMA can be computed as:SMA = Rs. (25 + 26 + 23 +24.9 + 25.3) / 5 = Rs. 24.84Weighted moving average: A weighted moving average (WMA) helps in covering for some of the flaws of SMA by adding more weightage to recent data rather than the past. WMA strictly uses the different price levels of a stock than SMA.Exponential moving average: This moving average is also referred to as EMA. It uses complex calculations, however, just as WMA, EMA adds more weightage to the latest stock prices. If EMA and SMA are compared for the same time periods, the former shows faster reaction than the latter due to more emphasis on the recent stock prices.Why are moving averages required?Moving average plays an important role in stock markets, especially while making buy-and-sell decisions.
