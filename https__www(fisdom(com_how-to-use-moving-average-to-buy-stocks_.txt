The next step is to divide the sum of prices by the total number of time periods.

For this, she considers the closing prices of the stock for the past 5 days.The closing prices are Rs. 25, Rs. 26, Rs. 23, Rs. 24.9 and Rs. 25.3The SMA can be computed as:SMA = Rs. (25 + 26 + 23 +24.9 + 25.3) / 5 = Rs. 24.84Weighted moving average: A weighted moving average (WMA) helps in covering for some of the flaws of SMA by adding more weightage to recent data rather than the past. WMA strictly uses the different price levels of a stock than SMA.Exponential moving average: This moving average is also referred to as EMA. It uses complex calculations, however, just as WMA, EMA adds more weightage to the latest stock prices. If EMA and SMA are compared for the same time periods, the former shows faster reaction than the latter due to more emphasis on the recent stock prices.Why are moving averages required?Moving average plays an important role in stock markets, especially while making buy-and-sell decisions.
