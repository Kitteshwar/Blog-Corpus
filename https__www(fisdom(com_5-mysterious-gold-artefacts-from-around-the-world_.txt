As an investor in Gold, it is quite riveting to find out that people were as obsessed with Gold even in the ancient recorded history. Let’s take a look at some of the most interesting gold artefacts with intense back-stories.Gold Rings of the Griffin WarriorIn 2015, the tomb of a 30-year-old Greek warrior was discovered by archaeologists in Southwestern Greece. Carbon-dating suggests that warrior belonged to 1500 BC and was known as the “Griffin Warrior.” The tomb contained 4 mysterious gold rings and had Minoan mythological imagery etched on it and were made of multiple layers of gold. Many believe that these rings were used to stamp official documents at the time. It is interesting because these rings mirror cultural communication between Minoans and Cretians and perhaps may not have powers like, ‘The Lord of the Rings’ but sure symbolize power. Great Golden Bell of DhammazeiThe Bell of Dhammazei located in Myanmar belongs to the 1500s. It was made out of an alloy of silver, copper and gold. It is said to weigh about 300 tons. However, a Portuguese mercenary Felipe de Brito dragged it to the Bago River, unlawfully. Due to the weight, the bell sank into the river. The bell was lost ever since and no amount of innovation has helped to locate it as the river changed its course for over 400 years ever since.The Golden Rhino of MapungubweThe Golden Rhino of Mapungubwe is a gold artefact from South Africa is composed of thin sheets of gold foil that had been literally hammered delicately on a frame made out of wood. Of course, 9 kilos of golden jewellery and other artefacts have also been found. The figurine was discovered in 1932, with confusions about which race of people in Soth Africa were responsible for it as it was considered contradictory to the apartheid ideology. However, experts believe that the Rhino of Mapungubwe was made during the precolonial period, regardless.Gold Plates of The Wind Gods22 small golden plates were discovered in the Java island. Dating far back as 800s AD, the plates have carvings depicting religious and spiritual symbols of Javanese version of Hindu religion. The artefact of these plates was found by temple workers in the remains of a candi, or temple, found in Ringilarik village. The inscriptions give the cardinal directions of the wind gods of Javanese Hinduism. There are 8 different wind gods mentioned in the tablets. While the country is predominantly followers of Islam it was interesting to find hidden proofs of diversity.Golden Crown of The Greek Goddess of LoveThis is a hilarious tale because the artefact was found in the most unexpected place. In Britain, an old man found this under his bed inside a cardboard box that he had inherited from his grandfather. The artefact is approximately 2300-year-old and made of pure gold. Experts guess that it was made around 300 BC. The crown weight about 100 grams and was determined to be a myrtle wreath related to the goddess of love Aphrodite. The grandfather had supposedly travelled around in the 1940s and 1950s with a lot of interest in Alexander the Great. While were or he found this artefact will always be a mystery, such inheritance is considerably pleasant.We wish that you too find such inheritance under your bed, left by your grandparents but it doesn’t happen often.
