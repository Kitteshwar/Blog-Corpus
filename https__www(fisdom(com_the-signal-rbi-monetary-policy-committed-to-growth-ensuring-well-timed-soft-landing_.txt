Reduction in excise and VATon fuel prices is expected to support demand. While prospects of economic activity are steadilyimproving, private consumption is still below pre-pandemic levels. The sluggish present state of theeconomy and private consumption warrants continued support for durable recovery.The Central Bank has stated that it holds strong buffer to manage global spill overs and inflation isbroadly aligned with targets. The Governor asserted confidence while stating that the Central Bank isbetter prepared to deal with the economic ramifications of the pandemic.The RBI will release a discussion paper on charges on digital payments. It is to also launch UnifiedPayments Interface (UPI)-based Feature Phone Products. Further, UPI caps for gilts, retail and IPOs areto be enhanced to Rs 5 lakhStance & RatesThe committee has voted 5:1 in favour of a ‘accommodative’ stance to revive and sustain economicgrowth on a durable basis.Policy rates are held steady for the ninth consecutive time. Repo pegged at 4% and Reverse Repo at3.35%. Marginal Standing Facility and Bank Rate also held steady at 4.25%.ProjectionsRBI’s projection for real GDP growth remains at 9.5% while projection for Q3FY22 trimmed to 6.6%from 6.8% and Q4FY22 trimmed to 6% from 6.1%.Headline inflation expected to peak in Q4FY22 before normalising thereafter. Target CPI inflation forFY22 pegged at 5.3%. CPI inflation expected to be around 5.1% in Q3FY22 and 5.7% in Q4FY22 beforesettling around 5% through Q1FY23.CPI inflation excluding food & fuel since Jun’20 remains to be a policy concern with the increasingprobability of input cost pressures to be transmitted rapidly into retail inflation.Actions & ExercisesRBI remains committed to maintaining an accommodative stance for as long as the economy needs it.At the same time, it will be open to proactively utilising Open Market Operations tools and operationtwist as and deemed necessary.RBI will re-establish 14-day VRRR auction as the go-to liquidity management exercise. VRRR target waspre-announced to be pegged at INR 6 Lakh Crore by 3rd Dec’21. The Central Bank has also beenconducting 28-day VRRR auctions and has expressed that going ahead, 14-day VRRR operations willbe complemented by longer duration auction programs with size and maturity being decided basiscontinuous assessment of evolving liquidity situation.TLTRO (targeted long-term repo operations) will continue till the terminal date. It is proposed to returnto normal dispensation under the MSF window. Banks can dip into two percent of NDTL with effectfrom January 1, 2022, as against three percent now. Banks will be allowed to make a one timeprepayment.The Governor shared targeted 14-day VRRR auction sizes as INR 6.5 Lakh Crore on 17th Dec’21 and INR7.5 Lakh Crore on 31st Dec’21. He also stated that going ahead, Jan’22 onwards, liquidity absorptionexercises will be primarily through the auction route.Our TakeThough largely anticipated, the decision to hold rates steady reflects the Central Bank’s commitmentto economic growth. The announcement is expected to accentuate confidence among economicparticipants and trigger a stronger spirit tuned for recovery.We expect the Central Bank to face pressures for policy normalisation sooner than later if risks suchas global policy normalisation, beyond expected fuel-led inflationary pressure, accelerated demand ledinflation materialises. The Central Bank has asserted that liquidity management would be doneprimarily through use of auctions. However, if a risk-induced situation materialises and warrants apolicy rate action by the next MPC meet scheduled February 2022, we can expect the Central Bank tofirst modify the reverse repo rate and wait before it amends the repo rate.
