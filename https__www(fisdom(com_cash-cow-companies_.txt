However, there are also some products that are evergreen, i.e., the demand for them never ceases. The companies having these products have already put in the hardwork and have managed to create a profit making product through years of research and development as well as understanding the market dynamics. The resultant product is a market leader and has created success stories over and over again. Such companies need not put in too many efforts to drastically change their products or find new variations to attract consumers. They simply need to fine tune their products or strategies to fit the current market conditions. These products become a money making machine for the company and are, therefore, also referred to as cash-cow products and the companies being cash-cow companies. This term is usually used in the BCG matrix and coined by them to classify companies and their business models. As mentioned, cash-cow companies have products that usually enjoy an undisputed maximum market share. The income from such products is usually twice its overall expenses and can help fund other operations of the business. This eliminates the need for excessive external finance and helps in reducing the cash outflow from the business in the form of huge interest payments and ultimately reducing the overall cost of capital. What are the characteristics of cash-cow companies?Investing in a cash-cow company can be beneficial for the investors as well. For this, they need to understand the key characteristics of such companies that can help in identifying them.

The current ratio of such companies is usually 2 or more which implies that its current assets are more than twice to accommodate the short term liabilities. Quick ratio of such companies is sufficiently high, usually 1 or more, to indicate a comfortable liquidity position and ensure that there is no cash crunch to meet its growth or mandatory financial obligations. The capital appreciation of the stock may be lower but investors can expect a more or less steady source of income through dividends. What are the advantages of cash-cow companies?Some of the ke advantages of cash-cow companies are mentioned below.Investment in cash-cow companies can benefit te investors as they are considered to be low risk investments.

Revenues from cash-cow streams of the business can also be used as reserves for a rainy day or in times or recession to stabilize the organization. Cash-cow companies or products enjoy market dominance and are therefore price makers as well. They set a benchmark for the industry or the product in terms of quality or accessibility. What are the disadvantages of cash-cow companies? Limitations are part of every market or industry and some of the key limitations of cash-cow companies or products are mentioned below. These companies or products enjoy larger market share often to the point of monopoly. This dominance discourages new players from entering the markets and can ruin small players by completely eliminating them from the industry. Such companies need to constantly maintain their product quality and services offered to enjoy the continual customer trust. Any deviation can lead to loss of customer faith and they will end up losing their market dominance. These companies cannot enjoy or expect any drastic increase in market share or profits as they are already at the mature levels and they simply need to be maintained.Creating the same amount of confidence and market presence for another product in the same industry can be difficult. Conclusion It is ideal for a company to have atleast one cash-cow product that can generate a steady source fo revenue to meet all its obligations and also fund research and development in other areas of the business. Such companies or products do not need continual excessive capital investment and can therefore be beneficial to the business and the investors alike for almost perpetuity. FAQsWhat is usually the cure ratio of cash-cow companies?The current ratio of cash-cow companies is usually 2 or more.What are the other classifications as per BCG matrix?Other classifications as per BCG matrix includes question marks, cash-cows, stars and dogs.What is the classic characteristic of cash-cow companies?The classic characteristic of cash-cow companies is having a strong product that enjoys market dominance and is low maintenance at the same time.How can a new entrant destroy a cash-cow product?A new entrant in a companies cash-cow product segment can destroy the market by introducing a new technology or a similar product with better market innovation that can potentially change the industry altogether.Share the article                      Get exclusive content
