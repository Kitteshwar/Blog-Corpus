The entire senior management team of HDFC Ltd along with its employees will be retained post the merger.How will HDFC and HDFC Bank customers benefit from the merger?The HDFC and HDFC Bank merger is being described as a coming together of equals. The customers of both organizations will therefore be the biggest beneficiaries. Until the merger process is complete in the next 1-1.5 years, HDFC Ltd and HDFC Bank will be operating as separate entities.
