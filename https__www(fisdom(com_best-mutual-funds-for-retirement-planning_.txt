Since retirement planning is essentially planning for the long-term, mutual funds fit the bill as far as investment options for meeting the income goals are concerned. However, one cannot invest in any available mutual fund category to generate the desired income. The best mutual fund investments for retirement planning are those that offer diversification to the portfolio and reduce the risks involved.The key to good retirement planning through mutual funds is to ensure right asset allocation. Often, while selecting the best mutual funds for retirement planning, investors ask these questions, where to invest, how to invest, how much to invest, etc. Here, we will address these questions and share some of the best mutual funds that investors can choose for retirement planning.

There are various mutual fund categories ranging from long-term to short-term and high-risk and low-risk. An investor can choose a ratio in which to assign funds into mutual fund categories. While deciding the ratio, age is one of the most significant aspects to be considered. Mutual fund selection should change according to the different life stages of an investor. For a young investor, it makes sense to invest in equity-oriented funds as compared to a middle-aged investor who should try to choose a hybrid fund with a mix of equity and debt investments. Similarly, as one grows older and nears retirement, debt mutual funds become the safer choice.Mutual fund selection also depends on individual risk-taking capacity. Often, young investors have a higher risk tolerance and therefore invest a significant portion in equity funds as compared to older investors who would prefer debt funds. Which mutual funds to invest in for retirement planning?Here, we will cover some of the top-performing mutual funds for different investment time horizons. Investors can select these based on personal investment time horizon and by weighing their risk appetite against the mutual fund’s risk rating.Watch this video on YouTubeMutual fund options for retirement planning if you are in the 50s and 60sIf your age falls within the 50-60 years bracket, you are almost near your retirement or may have already retired. By this time, you may have already formed a retirement corpus but if you would like to add to this corpus, you can invest in short-term mutual funds. These funds are mostly debt oriented and allow liquidity while providing sufficient income potential. Since debt funds carry lower risk levels, you can comfortably invest in these to ensure continued income while retiring. Short-Term FundsShort-Term Mutual funds are open-ended schemes that have a maturity period between 15 to 91 days. The maturity period generally varies as per the maturity period of the underlying assets or investments. These funds primarily invest in high-quality assets that carry low risk. These make for an ideal investment choice for those who are risk averse and require higher liquidity. Kotak Bond Short Term FundAbout the Fund Kotak Bond Short Term Fund is a debt mutual fund scheme that invests 96.46% of its corpus in debt.
