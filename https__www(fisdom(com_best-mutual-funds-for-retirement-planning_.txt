There are various mutual fund categories ranging from long-term to short-term and high-risk and low-risk. An investor can choose a ratio in which to assign funds into mutual fund categories. While deciding the ratio, age is one of the most significant aspects to be considered. Mutual fund selection should change according to the different life stages of an investor. For a young investor, it makes sense to invest in equity-oriented funds as compared to a middle-aged investor who should try to choose a hybrid fund with a mix of equity and debt investments. Similarly, as one grows older and nears retirement, debt mutual funds become the safer choice.Mutual fund selection also depends on individual risk-taking capacity. Often, young investors have a higher risk tolerance and therefore invest a significant portion in equity funds as compared to older investors who would prefer debt funds. Which mutual funds to invest in for retirement planning?Here, we will cover some of the top-performing mutual funds for different investment time horizons. Investors can select these based on personal investment time horizon and by weighing their risk appetite against the mutual fund’s risk rating.Watch this video on YouTubeMutual fund options for retirement planning if you are in the 50s and 60sIf your age falls within the 50-60 years bracket, you are almost near your retirement or may have already retired.
