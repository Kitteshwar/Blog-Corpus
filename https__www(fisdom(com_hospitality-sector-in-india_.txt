India has been known as a traditionally hospitable country since the people have been following an ancient culture of welcoming guests with open hands. Hospitality is known to be the very essence of India. However, transforming it into a commercial industry is attributed to westernisation and rapid economic development.The hospitality sector in India broadly includes the following:Lodging and boardingTransportationFood and drinksAmusement parksTheme parks, etcRecent growth in hospitality sectorWithin the hospitality industry, the hotel performance across most major cities in India saw significant growth in 2021 after the end of the Covid-19 second wave and before the third wave set in. Apart from leisure travel, the sector saw revenues coming in from corporate travel as businesses restarted after lock-downs. Due to this recovery in recent months, there has since been improved confidence in the sector.People are increasingly going on staycations, long weekend getaways, and also social gatherings such as weddings. This has resulted in business growth for the hospitality sector. Additionally, better road infrastructure across the country, especially holiday destinations like hill regions, has provided a much-needed boost to road travel.Such an immediate recovery after Covid-19 led downturn may not have been possible if it was not for the change in the mindset of travellers. This is majorly attributed to the higher vaccination percentage across the nation. Experts believe that this sector will likely recover fully this year despite the uncertainty about new Covid variants and consequent waves.Prospects of the hospitality sectorThe hospitality sector in India is expected to attain a value above Rs. 1,000 bn by the end of 2023. This estimate is considering the industry’s expansion rate at a CAGR of nearly 5% observed during the 2018-2021 period. This growth is highly attributed to the high number of foreign tourists and business executives visiting the country through 2018-2019 combined with the higher disposable income of the Indian population, as seen in the last decade.Some of the country’s top hotel brands include:Marriott International, ITC Hotels, Oberoi Hotels & Resorts.The Indian Hotels Company Limited, Lemon Tree Hotels,Accor Hotels, Radisson Hotel Group,Hyatt Hotels, Sarovar Hotels andIntercontinental Hotels GroupAs per statistics of 2017 and 2018, the occupancy rate of some of these hotels increased by nearly 65% due to rising demand from leisure as well as business travellers. (source – 1. https://www.marketresearch.com/Netscribes-India-Pvt-Ltd-v3676/Hotel-India-12379982/2. https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/hospitality-industry-in-india )What will drive growth in this sector?In the year 2017 alone, the net foreign tourist arrivals in the country were 10.04 Mn and this number increased to 6.75 Mn by August 2018. This meant a year-on-year growth rate of 7.5%. As the country continues to attract foreign tourists and business travellers, the growth in hospitality is set to resume as Covid-19 restrictions ease. The Indian government eased its hospitality-related investment policy to allow 100% foreign direct investment (FDI) in the country’s tourism construction projects, hotel and resort developments, and establishment of recreational facilities. This has proven to be a major boost towards the development of new hotel chains in the country.Possible hindrances to growth in this sectorThe implementation of the goods and services tax (GST) was seen as a growth-deterrent by the hospitality industry as customers felt the pinch of high expenses being levied. Rising competition has been another challenge faced by most businesses involved in the hospitality sector. As the Indian consumer mindset is experiencing a drastic shift due to rising exposure to foreign tourism combined with Covid-19 related hygiene expectations, hospitality businesses are facing many challenges to meet many of these expectations. Top stocks in the hospitality sector in IndiaMentioned below are the top hospitality companies (as per market capitalisation) listed on the Indian stock exchanges.1.
