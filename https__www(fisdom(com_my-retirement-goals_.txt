We need to create a retirement corpus so that by age sixty we are financially free. A person is financially free when you don’t need to work to pay your bills. You should have enough assets that generate enough income today and for the rest of your life. We all know inflation is relentless, and even when the rate of inflation falls it does not mean that prices go down. They just rise more slowly. Getting the right amount of retirement is not tough to crack.At the age of twenty-five save 25 percent of your post-tax income, at age thirty save 30 percent of your post-tax income, At forty save 40 percent.
