Therefore, investors do not have to actively readjust their portfolios depending on market fluctuations. Hence, it makes these funds an ideal investment option for new investors who have a higher risk appetite and a longer investment horizon along with limited knowledge to invest or create a portfolio on their own. Taxation Most balanced advantage funds are taxed in line with equity funds. However, their ultimate taxation depends on the composition of the fund at the time of redemption of units. If the fund has dominant assets belonging to equity and equity instruments, the fund is STCG from the fund and is taxed at a flat rate of 15%. On the other hand, LTCG in such a case is taxed at a flat rate of 10% after the initial exemption of Rs.1,00,000. When the fund has debt and debt instruments as the dominant asset class, the fund will be taxed in line with debt funds. In such a case, the STCG from the fund will be taxed as per the applicable slab rate of the individual investor and LTCG will be taxed at a flat rate of 20% after the benefit of indexation.Fund manager expertise and experience The performance of these funds is highly dependent on the expertise and experience of fund managers. The ability of the fund managers to navigate the market trends and utilize these fluctuations to maximize the returns is the key to a successful portfolio. Investors can thus invest in these funds and can earn potentially higher returns.Risk-adjusted returns The returns from balanced advantage funds are risk-adjusted that usually beat inflation. The risk of these funds is higher but the returns from these funds compensate for such risk and are higher than that in the case of debt funds and other traditional investment options. ConsSome of the challenges of investing in balanced advantage funds are,Higher cost The expense ratio of a mutual fund is associated with the cost of investing in these funds.
