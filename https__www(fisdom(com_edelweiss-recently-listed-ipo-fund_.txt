Boasting one of the biggest markets globally, the economically healthier country is poised to see home-grown talent take centerstage across seas and oceans.The heavily revamped business behaviors of the Indian market set-up in the post-covid world are an  emblem of the unrealized potential that Indian equities have to offer. The dynamic shift of the  unorganized to organized sector, all-time high corporate profits, supportive macro support, and holistic bottom-up growth strategies, will further augur the unrealized potential that strategic investment principles can yield over the long-term.What’s mentioned above is what the mass retail can see.

But the mass market crowd is not to blame as access to IPO subscription is not skewed in their favors.The table below highlights the difficulty retail participants face in benefiting from value unlocking:IPO markets are a mix of hits and misses. It is paramount to understand the business and market sentiment at the time of listing to make the most of fresh listings.
