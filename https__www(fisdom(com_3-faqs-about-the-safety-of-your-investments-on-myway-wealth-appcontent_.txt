Even though Fisdom makes it very easy to signup and finishes paperless KYC in 5 minutes to start investing in Direct Mutual Funds, yet many of our users do hesitate to make their first investment. As Head of Research at Fisdom , I have answered some of the questions that you may have regarding your investments with Fisdom app:1. What happens to my investments in case Fisdom shuts down?Fisdom is just a distributor of  Mutual Funds. As an intermediary, your money never comes directly to Fisdom . Instead, your money goes to the AMC (Asset Management Companies such as SBI, ICICI, Motilal Oswal, etc) associated with the Mutual Fund you invest in. Thus your money moves from your bank account to the mutual fund’s bank account directly. Similarly for redemption, your money is credited by AMC directly to your bank account. If the app/platform shuts down, your units would be safe as long as you have the folio number (which you can get from your eCAS i.e. Consolidated Account Statement which is available from Karvy, CAMS or SBFS) – and then you would just need to find a different app for your mutual fund redemption/investments.2. But the markets are falling, should I withdraw my investments?Its common to panic and stop SIPs when the markets are down due to fear of loss. However, a fall in the market is an opportunity to buy more at lower prices, and this will help you achieve your long-term goals. Remember: Every bear trend is followed by the bull, resulting in the recovery of the market. Thus, time in the market is vital rather than timing the market.3.
