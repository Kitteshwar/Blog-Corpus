It is a quicker and hassle-free process that does not need more regulations. But the Adani Group has chosen the FPO route to meet its capital requirements and to meet many criticisms through a single move. The meteoric growth of the Adani group stocks is a story of legends but this growth is often overshadowed by critics pointing out the tremendous increase in the debt levels of Adani Group companies.Through this FPO, Adani Enterprises will be able to reduce the excessive leverage that has been accumulated through its multiple acquisitions in various sectors.
