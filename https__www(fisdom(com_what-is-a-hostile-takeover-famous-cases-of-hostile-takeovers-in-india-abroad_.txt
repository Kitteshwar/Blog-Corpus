Under a hostile takeover, the acquiring company can make a direct offer to the shareholders of the target company in order to purchase their shares bypassing the  management and the Board of the company. Such an offer is generally at a premium price to attract shareholders with significant gains. The primary reasons for a hostile takeover can be the analysis that the target company is undervalued or has few strategic assets that directly complement the business of the acquiring company. The synergy of the resources can boost the growth trajectory of the acquiring company and can also increase its overall market share.What are a few strategies for hostile takeovers?Hostile takeovers are complex and often require significant planning, resources, and expertise. The strategies for executing a hostile takeover can vary depending on the specific circumstances and goals of the acquiring company. Some of the common strategies for hostile takeovers are mentioned below. Tender offerA tender offer is a public offer made by the acquiring company. This offer is made with the aim to purchase a substantial portion or all of the outstanding shares of the target company directly from its shareholders. The offer is usually made at a premium price that is significantly above the current market value of shares of the target company. This increased offer is to incentivize the company’s shareholders to sell their shares.Proxy fight A proxy fight is a battle for control of the Board of Directors in the target company. The acquiring company may seek to nominate its own directors to replace the current board. This is with the aim to gain control of the company’s decision-making process. This mode of a hostile takeover is often costly and time-consuming and requires the support of a significant number of shareholders.Down raidsDown raids are referred to the sudden entry of the predator acquirer in the open markets. The acquirer company attempts to buy a significant stake in the target company at a higher than current value in a very short time. This also allows them the element of surprise and an opportunity to buy a controlling stake. This type of acquisition is followed by a further takeover offer or similar action over the course of an acquisition attempt. What are the defensive strategies against hostile takeovers?Companies facing hostile takeovers may employ several defensive strategies as protection from the acquiring company. These strategies are designed with the aim to make the company less attractive or give the target company’s management more time to consider the acquisition and explore their options. Some defensive strategies against a hostile takeover include,Scorched earthThis is the last ditch effort against a hostile takeover. The aim of this strategy is to make the target company less attractive and make them lose interest in the acquisition. Under this strategy, the target company may sell off key assets or may increase its overall debt making the acquisition more expensive.Pac-Man DefenseThe Pac-Man defense strategy is where the target company makes a counteroffer to acquire the acquiring company. This essentially is turning the tables on the acquiring company and making them reconsider their offer. Golden ParachuteUnder this strategy, a financial incentive is given to the top executives of the target company in the event of a change in ownership or control. This makes the overall acquisition more expensive for the acquiring company making it less attractive or feasible. White KnightUnder this strategy, the target company seeks a white knight who is a friendly acquirer that steps in as a competing entity for the acquiring company. When the target company is acquired by the white knight, the former gets a more favourable buyer and can avoid the negative consequences of a hostile takeover.Top cases of hostile takeover in India and abroadHostile takeovers are relatively rare in the Indian market. Some of the top cases of hostile takeovers in India and abroad are mentioned below. The hostile takeover attempt by Reliance Industries Limited of L&T Finance in 2011. The former acquired a 14.98% stake in the subsidiary of the engineering conglomerate L&T, without L&T’s approval.
