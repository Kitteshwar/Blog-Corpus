Asset Allocation: Once you arrive at the corpus when you retire, you must decide on your asset allocation. There might be a mix of asset class such as equities, fixed income and gold. One can be overweight on equities in the initial stages of life and have minor allocation to fixed income and gold.You can reduce equity exposure by 10% for every five years lesser than the base twenty five years and replace it with fixed income and gold, without letting gold comprise more than 10% of the portfolio at any given point in time. As example, for twenty five years to retirement, equity can compromise and other asset class can take charge.3.
