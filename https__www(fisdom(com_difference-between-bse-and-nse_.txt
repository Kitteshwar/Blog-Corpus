Among the various stock exchanges in India, two stock exchanges enjoy the most popularity considering their size, NSE and BSE. Here, we will discuss each of these and highlight key differences for new investors to know the better option of the two.What is NSE?NSE, or the National Stock Exchange, was established in 1992 and was the first exchange in India to provide an automated electronic trading system.NSE was known to be at the forefront of the electronic settlement system, replacing the paper-based share settlement in the country. Since its inception, NSE has fast evolved its electronic trading platform to suit the ever-changing demands of the share market. In the present day, the stock exchange can alone handle more than 16,000 orders per second and even possesses the capability to scale up as needed.NSE, in partnership with some of the country’s leading financial institutions, formed the country’s first Depository – NSDL [National Securities Depository Limited].

Although it was established way back in 1875, it was only recognized as an official stock exchange in 1957. In 1995, the exchange came up with its online share trading platform known as BSE Online Trading System (BOLT). BSE partnered with some of the country’s leading banks to establish CDSL [Central Depository Services (India) Limited]. Today, all the country’s leading stock exchanges are connected with the CDSL.Did you knowDespite their popularity and penetration, NSE and BSE see participation from only about 2.5% of the country’s population. Difference between NSE and BSEThe table below highlights the main differences between NSE and BSE:ParameterNSEBSEMeaningNSE or National Stock Exchange is India’s largest stock exchange offering a completely automated trading set-up.BSE or Bombay Stock Exchange is the country’s and also Asia’s oldest stock exchange that offers high-speed trading.Established onIt was founded in 1992 and recognized in 1993.BSE was founded in 1875 and recognised in 1957.Global rankingNSE ranks 11th among the world’s largest stock exchanges.BSE ranks 10th among the worlds’ largest stock exchanges.Index nameNSE’s benchmark index is called NIFTY 50.

Considering the scale of each of these exchanges, their indices also indicate the overall economic health of the Indian markets. If a company plans to raise money through investors, it must get registered with a recognised stock exchange through an IPO.

As it grows, the company can attract more investors and therefore more shares can be issued. All such transactions can be carried out in the stock markets through a stock exchange, such as NSE or BSE. ConclusionAn investor who is new to the stock markets may be confused while selecting between NSE and BSE.
