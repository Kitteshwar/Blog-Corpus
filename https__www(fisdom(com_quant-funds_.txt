Quant funds focus on establishing automated programs to make investment decisions instead of relying on a fund manager’s ability to pick stocks while forming a portfolio. Unlike, quant fund managers are not entirely passive. They are often involved in the design and monitoring of the model that helps in making portfolio construction.Why invest in Quant Funds?Here are some of the benefits offered by quant funds:Minimal human interference – A quant fund uses a pre-defined quantitative model to select stocks. This eliminates human interference and therefore, the chances of bias in stock selection. For instance, if a fund house uses a model for stock selection based on a positive track record, it automatically eliminates stocks of companies that are highly leveraged and have volatile performance. Automated market-focused strategies- With a quantitative model, strategies can be designed such that there is higher consistency across various market conditions. During market downturns, the fund managers of actively managed funds may exit certain investments and modify their style of investment. Lower expense ratio-Since quant funds are somewhat passively managed, the expense ratio could be lower than the actively managed funds. For instance, DSP Quant fund has an expense ratio of 0.55% against a regular active mutual fund that could charge around 1% as expense ratio.Built-in Checks to reduce inefficiency-The models used in quant funds have built-in checks for identifying stock concentration and sector focus.Choosing a Quant Mutual FundsHere are some factors to consider when choosing a quant mutual fund for Indian investors:Performance: Look at the fund’s past performance over different time periods. This will give you an idea of how the fund has performed in different market conditions.Expense ratio: This is the fee charged by the fund house for managing your money. Look for funds with lower expense ratios as they can eat into your returns.Risk: Quant funds can be riskier than other types of mutual funds. Look at the fund’s risk profile and make sure it aligns with your investment goals and risk tolerance.Investment strategy: Different quant funds use different investment strategies. Make sure you understand the fund’s investment strategy and how it fits into your overall investment plan.Who should invest in Quant Funds?Quant funds can be ideal for seasoned investors. This is because the funds use highly specialized and sophisticated techniques for investment selection.
