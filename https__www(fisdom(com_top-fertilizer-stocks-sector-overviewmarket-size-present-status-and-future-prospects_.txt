Urea, a nitrogen source, remains at the top of the list in fertilizer consumption. In 2020 alone, the consumption of this fertilizer in India reached more than 33 million tons.Fertilizer industry – what do the statistics say?By 2020, the Indian fertilizer sector had already achieved a valuation of Rs. 887 billion. This growth has been mainly attributed to increased fertilizer consumption to achieve sustainable grain production in the country. As per projections, the industry is expected to achieve a CAGR of 11.9% from 2022 to 2026.

However, there were other challenges during the lockdown phase, including a shortage of labour, raw material shortage, and the subsequent impact on shipments. Interesting factIndia is the world’s second-largest fertilizer consumer as it consumes more than 55 million tons of fertilizers annually.Some of the key factors that are driving growth in the sector are:India is known as an agricultural nation. Since it is one of the world’s largest agricultural producers offering crops like rice, pulses, wheat, potatoes, groundnut, etc, the higher demand for fertilizer products is going to continue. In the long run, rising agricultural production to cater to the world’s growing food demands are expected to drive fertilizer demand in the country. The Indian government has also been focusing on extending maximum support to farmers by allowing easier access to subsidized fertilizers and newer technologies. This boosts agriculture and, thereby, fertilizer production.There has also been a significant surge in fertilizers’ production capacities across India. This is said to be driven by government initiatives to cut down on fertilizer imports and boost domestic fertilizer production.Key challenges faced by the fertilizer industryFertilizer manufacturers in the country are continuing to face some challenges.
