Here, 1 is considered best and 10 is worst. A CIBIL rank ranging between 4 and 1 is considered good by lending institutions. The two central parameters that go into calculating a business CIBIL rank include repayment behaviour and credit utilization. CIBIL rank is assigned only to those companies or businesses that have outstanding loans ranging between Rs. 10 lakhs to Rs. 10 crores. However, if a business does not have a CIBIL rank assigned, it cannot be considered as a negative factor. It only means that the company does not fulfil the criteria meant for CIBIL rank calculation.What is a Company Credit Report?A company credit report or CCR is a detailed document that contains information on the financial health of a company or business. A CCR is constructed using information gathered from various credit institutions.

CCR would normally include the following set of information:Background information–The initial sections of the report include the business’s background information such as business ownership, parent and subsidiary companies, years of operation, etc.CIBIL rank–The report contains the business’s CIBIL rank, a 1 digit number ranging between 1-10.

To improve a business CIBIL rank and CCR, a business needs to consider various factors impacting the same. Here are some of the key points to work on for ensuring a good financial track record for any business:Whenever a business avails a business loan or credit, it must be taken in the name of the company as against an individual.

It is sensible to take loans that the business can afford to pay back in time. Every business must try to maintain a healthy balance of incoming and outgoing transactions for good financial health.Taking long-term business and repaying them on time can help in establishing a good credit image of the business or company among lenders. ConclusionFor fast and easy access to credit, businesses must constantly work towards maintaining a good CIBIL score and CIBIL rank.
