The above graph illustrates only the top five sectors bought and sold; however, the total value of stocks bought & sold in Mar’19 was INR 2,350 Cr. & INR 1,645 Cr. – net buying of over INR 700 Cr.Top stocks purchased by the mutual fund industry included BHEL (electrical equipment), Sheela Foam (furnishing), IDFC First Bank (private banking), Endurance Technologies (2/3-wheeler),Aarti Industries (pharmaceutical chemicals). At the same time, stocks offloaded included Vijaya Bank (public sector bank), Engineers India (consulting services), matrimony (digital services),LIC housing finance (HFC) & PVR (entertainment).The way ahead? While last month was dedicated towards re-aligning the portfolio, we expect the election season bring along a strong wave of consumerism as each contesting party carries a populist manifesto, India’s inflation remains within target range & the central bank focuses on credit offtake & liquidity.What should an investor do? The time is well-suited for investors to step up their SIP amounts or perhaps start deploying fresh funds in a systematic manner. For the adventurous, investing in funds focused on sectors like private financial institutions, consumption and similar may augur well.Explore the app or write back to us to know more about the themes & funds that we believe hold solid promise for the time to come.Explore MoreIf you have any concern, please write to us at ask@fisdom.com or call at 080 48039999, we would be happy to answer your query.Thanks, Nirav (Head of Research) Fisdom  The SignalWeekly Dose  The Signal (weekly highlights) 02 Sep  3 minutes   The SignalWeekly Dose  The Signal (weekly highlights) 26 Aug  3 minutes   The SignalWeekly Dose  The Signal (weekly highlights) 19 Aug  4 minutes   The SignalWeekly Dose  The Signal (weekly highlights) 12 Aug  3 minutes   The SignalWeekly Dose  The Signal (weekly highlights) 05 Aug  3 minutes   The SignalWeekly Dose  The Signal (weekly highlights) 29 Jul  3 minutes   Weekly Dose  The Signal (weekly highlights) 27 May  3 minutes   Weekly Dose  The Signal (weekly highlights) 13 May  3 minutes   Weekly Dose  The Signal (weekly highlights) 22 Apr  3 minutes   Weekly Dose  The Signal (weekly highlights) 15 Apr  2 minutes   Weekly Dose  The Signal (weekly highlights) 08 Apr  3 minutes   Weekly Dose  The Signal (weekly highlights) 01 Apr  3 minutes
