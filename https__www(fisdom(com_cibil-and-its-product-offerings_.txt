It ranges from 300 to 900. The closer one’s CIBIL score is to 900, the better and preferred the credit rating.CIBIL maintains credit records of more than 600 million individuals and nearly 32 million businesses. In India, credit scores are referred as CIBIL scores.Why is CIBIL score important?CIBIL score is a very important aspect that is considered by most lenders in any loan application process. When a borrower approaches a bank or a lending institution for a loan or credit card, the lender checks the applicant’s CIBIL score and credit report. In case the CIBIL score is low, the lender may not process the application. For high CIBIL scores, lenders will consider the application and other details while determining the creditworthiness of the borrower.A CIBIL score is used by lenders to gauge the first impression of any borrower. The higher the CIBIL score, the better one’s chances of easily securing a loan. Although lenders consider CIBIL scores, the decision on granting a loan or credit is solely dependent on the lender.CIBIL reports and scores play a very crucial role in one’s financial journey. These determine the eligibility of individuals or businesses while availing a loan or a credit card. Financial institutions may be willing to approve higher credit limits to borrowers who have a good credit score and report. CIBIL score also influences the interest rates applicable to loans. A high CIBIL score can fetch lower interest rates and allow borrowers to negotiate with lenders in this regard.How does CIBIL use credit history in credit reports?Credit history is a complete track record of a borrower’s repayment of past debts. A credit report generated by CIBIL will keep a record of the borrower’s credit history. Credit history is essentially gathered by CIBIL from various sources, including banks, credit card companies, collection agencies, governments, etc. CIBIL uses a borrower’s credit history to incorporate various elements in credit reports, such as the borrower’s creditworthiness, credit behaviour, credit using pattern, and overall credit standing.ConclusionIf you wish to achieve your financial goals as per pre-determined timelines or even in case you have an emergency, you may require some form of credit.
