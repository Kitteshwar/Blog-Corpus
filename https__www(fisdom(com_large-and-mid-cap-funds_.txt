To fetch good returns from these, investors must look at a five to seven-year horizon. Here are some of the factors to be considered before investing in these funds:Large Cap funds are not risk-proof: Large Cap equity funds come with many risks that are often market-related. However, these risks are relatively moderate when compared to small-cap or mid-cap funds.Expense ratio: Large Cap funds have various expenses related to fund management.
