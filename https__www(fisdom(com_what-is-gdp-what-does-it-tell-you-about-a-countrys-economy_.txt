Let’s find out.GDP simplifiedGDP or Gross Domestic Product is the total monetary value of all goods and services generated within an economy during a period.

As the economy grows, businesses also grow and give rise to more jobs and rise in personal income. As the economy contracts, businesses slow down, resulting in delayed hiring. As jobs are fewer, the economy gets depressed further. Also, with lesser jobs in the market, people have less disposable income. A negative GDP growth rate means that the economy is undergoing a recession.India’s GDP growth storyAs per the estimates released by the National Statistics Office (NSO), for the year 2021-22, the Government of India revised its GDP growth estimate to 8.7%.
