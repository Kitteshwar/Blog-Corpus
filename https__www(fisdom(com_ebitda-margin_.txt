However, since it is not mandated under GAAP, it may not be used at all times. Due to the absence of accounting regulations in this case, companies may resort to unfair practices and modify EBITDA to reflect a positive outlook for investors.Inadequate measure of debt-reliant companiesEBITA is not a holistic measure to determine a company’s profitability, especially if it is using a significant amount of debt since it does not consider interest expense. It can therefore not be considered as a holistic metric for gauging the financial health of debt-heavy companies.Companies that have heavy debt usage may also shift focus on EBITDA margin from net profit margin to falsely tempt investors towards investing.Latest news on Zomato’s EBITDA playIn recent times, there have been concerns about certain tech startups using creative accounting methods to present a more favorable financial picture. For instance, Zomato, a food delivery and restaurant aggregator platform reported a positive adjusted EBITDA figure for the quarter ending in December 2020, despite significant losses in the past. This comes even as the company cut nearly 2,000 jobs in 2020, following the pandemic’s impact on its business.Many startups use non-standard metrics such as adjusted EBITDA to report their financial performance, which does not accurately reflect their financial health. However, Zomato faced social media backlash for using adjusted metrics in its quarterly financial results for the quarter ending June 2021, despite a net loss of INR 356 crores ($48 million). This sparked concerns over the validity of using adjusted metrics and accusations of financial manipulation. In response, Zomato argued that adjusted metrics are an industry standard and that it had followed proper accounting standards. The incident highlights the need for startups to focus on transparent financial reporting and communicate effectively with stakeholders about their financial performance.ConclusionEBITDA margin can provide a useful view of a company’s profitability and enable easier comparisons among companies within an industry. However, it’s recommended to use additional metrics within an analysis to get a more holistic picture of a company’s true value.FAQsWhat is the difference between EBITDA margin and net margin?Net margin is the ratio of net profit to total revenue.
