Here is an element-wise breakup of performance:The decline in consumer goods, read with emphasis on the steeper decline in consumer durables, reflect a demand-side pause as the lockdown-induced pent-up demand and recent festivity-led demand begins to lose steam. The slippage in capital goods production could be read as reflective of cuts in private capital expenditure and blocking of meaningful public expenditure.IIP numbers highlight the nascent and fragile stage of recovery that the Indian economy was in.We continue to keep an eye on efficient implementation of public policies which can be expected to bolster the economy at large. Resurgence of health risks in fragmented pockets of the nation, disrupted supply-side economics and overtly cautious retail consumption continue to be prominent risks to India’s full-blown economic recovery.However, it is to be noted that, IIP metrics in isolation is inadequate to form a holistic view of the state of economy. IIP metrics should be considered as indicative from a directional standpoint while taking into consideration the statistical limitations and lag nature of the metric.Click Here to read MoSPI’s original press release on ‘Quick estimates of index of industrial production and use-based index for the month of January, 2021’  Macroscope  Macroscope – Government Finances: Way Ahead 04 Jun  1 minute   Macroscope  Macroscope – Eight Core Industries Update 03 Jun  0 minutes   Macroscope  Macroscope – Indian Industrial Production (IIP) | Index For The Month May 2021 14 Jul  2 minutes   Macroscope  Macroscope – Inflation | CPI Inflation For The Month June 2021 13 Jul  3 minutes   Macroscope  Macroscope – Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) – Services PMI for the month June 2021 05 Jul  3 minutes   Macroscope  Macroscope – Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) – June 2021 02 Jul  3 minutes   Macroscope  Macroscope – CPI Inflation For The Month May 2021 15 Jun  3 minutes   Macroscope  Macroscope – WPI Inflation For The Month May 2021 15 Jun  3 minutes   Macroscope  Macroscope – Indian Industrial Production – Reading Of IIP Index For The Month April 2021 14 Jun  2 minutes   Macroscope  Macroscope – Purchasing Managers’ Index – Services PMI for the month May 2021 10 Jun  3 minutes   Macroscope  Macroscope – RBI Monetary Policy Meet – Policy Update for the month June 2021 04 Jun  3 minutes   Macroscope  Macroscope – Purchasing Managers’ Index – Manufacturing PMI for the month May 2021 01 Jun  3 minutes
