Some go through it when they reach 60 or 65 while some at a later age. However, at this stage, it is difficult to work as before due to physical, mental, and health-related constraints. Having a pension scheme that provides retirement benefits allows the individual to lead a comfortable life in their post-retirement period without being dependent on their children or others. It is also important to understand that having mere savings throughout life may not be enough to meet all the obligations on retirement. Therefore, investing in pension plans allows their savings to grow over the tenure of investment. The case of money generating money is the most efficient way to build a corpus and the power of compounding accelerates it further. A sound pension scheme will meet all the financial obligations of the individual as well as have room for any emergencies or other retirement goals like travel, holidays, etc.What are the factors to consider while purchasing a pension scheme? We have established the importance of pension schemes above. Let us now understand the key factors that need to be considered while planning or purchasing a pension scheme.Routine or monthly expenses in the post-retirement period The first and foremost consideration should be the monthly expenses that are part and parcel of life. This is the most basic requirement and cannot be ignored. Individuals can look at the current monthly budget and have a fair estimate of what they may need another 15-20 years down the line. A sound pension plan should be able to cover the routine expenses in the post-retirement period apart from any financial emergencies. Inflation The current expenses for basic necessities and other luxuries will not be the same in the post-retirement period. The reason for the same is inflation. Today the world as a whole is battling inflation and a sound pension scheme should also account for the same. Most experts believe that individuals should look at their annual income and have at least 80% of the same in their post-retirement period. Accounting for inflation will help individuals have a realistic corpus at the end of their working life that can meet their true financial obligations in retirement. Taxation Pension schemes often come with tax benefits. This is to encourage people to save more and invest more in pension schemes so they can have a secure financial future. Investors should therefore look for schemes that offer maximum tax benefits and at the same time acknowledge that saving tax should not be the sole purpose of investing in pension schemes. When tax saving is the sole focus, investors often ignore the real benefits upon retirement which ultimately defeats the purpose of a pension scheme. Outstanding financial obligations Individuals in the post-retirement period usually do not have any huge financial obligations like loans. However, there is always a chance that a person still has a couple of years of the balance loan amount that may be wrapped up soon. In any case, a pension plan should account for these outstanding financial obligations too so that at the time of retirement, the individual is not faced with the consequences of not meeting them. Different investment options There are multiple retirement-centric investment options available today for investors to choose from. The criteria to choose an investment option should be the amount of corpus that will be available upon maturity as well as the risk of investment among others. Investors need to understand the returns as well as the finer points or conditions of investment for each available option of pension schemes and choose a plan accordingly that meets all their expectations. Covering for medical emergencies Medical emergencies are a fact in the post-retirement period. Right from routine examinations or preventive health checkups to any medical emergencies, the cost of medical expenses is going to be high in retirement. Therefore, the pension scheme should accommodate such high expenses in a reasonable manner so as to ensure that retirees get the best medical attention whenever needed. Conclusion Pension schemes are a necessity for every individual and not something that can be avoided. We have often seen in India that an average person does not give retirement planning enough importance and often ignores it till the very last minute. At such a time, buying a pension scheme after considering all the above factors will not provide adequate benefits. Hence, it is important to plan for a pension scheme well in advance and consider all the factors mentioned above to have an effective one in the post-retirement period. FAQsWhat are the benefits of pension schemes in India?Pension schemes provide multiple benefits like tax benefits, insurance cover, liquidity, multiple payment options including guaranteed income at periodic intervals, long-term investment benefits, death benefits, accidental benefits, etc.What are some of the pension schemes available in India?Some of the pension schemes available in India are,-Deferred annuity plan-Immediate annuity plan-Certain annuity plan-Guaranteed periodic annuity-Life annuity pension plan-Life ULIP Plan-NPS-Pension fundsWhat is the benefit of using a retirement calculator?By using a retirement calculator, an individual can estimate the amount needed to invest today to get the estimated corpus upon maturity.What is the usual retirement age in India?The usual retirement age in India is between 58 years to 65 years depending on whether the individual is working in the public sector or private sector enterprise.   Retirement Planning  National Pension System (NPS) – login to NSDL and KFintech portal 16 Mar  10 minutes   Retirement Planning  National Pension Scheme (NPS) Returns for Tier 1 & Tier 2 08 Mar  5 minutes   Financial PlanningRetirement Planning  All You Need to Know About the FIRE Movement 08 Jan  7 minutes   Retirement Planning  Similarities and difference between NPS Tier 1 and Tier 2 05 Dec  5 minutes   Retirement Planning  Permanent Retirement Account Number(PRAN)- Requirement,How to apply? 02 Dec  5 minutes   Retirement Planning  NPS vs Old Pension Scheme(OPS)- Points you should be aware of 20 Nov  1 minute   Retirement Planning  Tips Every NRI Needs To Know About Retirement Planning 04 Nov  7 minutes   Retirement Planning  NPS Premature Withdrawal 04 Nov  8 minutes   Retirement Planning  How to Get a 50K Pension Per Month? 04 Nov  6 minutes   Retirement Planning  Best Time to Invest in Pension Scheme 04 Nov  7 minutes   Retirement Planning  एनपीएस – विशेषताएं, कर-लाभ व निवेश क्यों करें   27 Oct  1 minute   Retirement Planning  10 Tips to Ensure Successful Retirement Planning – Best practices for success 08 Sep  7 minutes
