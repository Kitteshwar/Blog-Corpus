In other words, it is the price difference between current and future securities. To do so, an arbitrage fund manager buys securities in the cash market to sell them in the future or derivatives market, and the difference in the two determines your short-term capital gains.Watch this video on YouTubeHow do they work?Arbitrage funds make use of the opportunities, such as the mis-pricing of stocks in the stock market. Returns are determined by the difference between buying and selling price of securities, irrespective of the subsequent price changes in the cash and futures market (expensive than the cash market because of a cost to carry & hold).For example, a fund manager buys a stock in the cash market at INR 1200, and its value is INR 1250 in the futures market. He can buy it at INR 1200 in the cash market and sell at INR 1250 in the futures market to make a profit. Now, on the last day of F&O expiry, the two markets will converge at one price. There could be three scenarios to determine your profit:The price goes up to INR 1,300, and in this you would make INR 100 in the cash market, while losing INR 50 in the futures market, making your net profit to be INR 20. If the price goes down to INR 1,100. At that point, you lose INR 100 in the cash market, while making INR150 in the futures market. Your profit is INR 50. If the price remains the same as INR 1,200, at that point in the cash market you don’t make any profit or lose anything, but make a profit of INR 50 in the futures market.In all the scenarios, you still make a profit of INR 50, and that is how you make the most of the arbitrage funds.What are the risks involved in Arbitrage Funds?While there is much in favour of arbitrage funds, one must not forget that extreme market conditions can also cause disruptions. Such as the case of a sharp market correction in March 2020 that led to a decline in futures pricing, further halting the fresh inflow of two asset management companies, ICICI Prudential Mutual Fund and Tata Mutual Fund. Market leaders suggest investors to wait for a minimum three-month period to avoid huge risks.Are Returns from Arbitrage Funds Worthwhile?Arbitrage funds have recorded an average return of 5.68% during the last calendar year (2020), and 5.75% in the past three calendar years, which is equivalent to 5.66% and 6.48% in the liquid funds.While there are considerable risks in the arbitrage funds category, given the market conditions, they are still a safer option for risk-averse investors if they reserve it for six to twelve months. Any longer than this period could become risky, as other hybrid categories come into the picture. Be that as it may, it is ideal to have an arbitrage fund manager to comprehend the subtleties of the risks and returns procedure of these funds.What Does The Investment Cost You?The Investment horizon of the arbitrage funds is a strong determinant, as there are several fees and charges attached to it, such as:Expense ratios: Annual fees (1.09% for a regular plan and 0.41% for a direct plan) that includes fund manager’s fees and the management charges, charged at a percentage of the overall security assets.Transaction costs: Unlike other funds, this is often consuming as there is frequent trading involved in the process.Exit fees: In order to keep investors from exiting at the initial stage, arbitrage funds levy exit loads (0.25%) for a period of 30 days.All these costs may increase your overall spend on the securities and may lower your take-home returns.What Is The Role Of An Arbitrage Fund Manager?The arbitrary fund manager’s job is to distinguish a chance in the spot and futures market. Likewise, the fund manager of the security guarantees that the resources are put into fixed-income securities to produce returns during low arbitrage openings.
