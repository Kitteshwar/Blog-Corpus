For such capital needs, the government often reaches out to the central bank of the country. The central bank or RBI will then borrow funds to provide to the government, thereby acting as the government’s banker.The RBI issues government securities with a fixed interest rate against the borrowed funds. These securities are known as Gilts. A Gilt fund, therefore, is a fund that primarily invests in Gilts, making at least 80% of the portfolio to constitute Gilts.   Table of Contents  hide   1 What are Gilt Funds with 10-year constant duration?   2 Difference between gilt funds and gilt funds with 10 year constant duration   3 Advantages of a 10-Year Gilt Fund   4 Are gilt mutual funds with a 10 year constant duration worth investing?   5 What is the tax implication of 10 year constant duration gilt funds?   6 How to invest in Gilt with 10 year Constant Duration Funds?   7 Top rated gilt mutual funds   8 Conclusion   9 FAQs   10 Also read.. Based on a structure similar to gilt funds, are 10-year constant duration Gilt funds. Here, we will discuss in detail about this variant of Gilt funds and also share top fund recommendations within this fund category.What are Gilt Funds with 10-year constant duration?A Gilt fund invests in Gilts, whereas a 10-year constant duration Gilt fund invests in Gilts and government securities that have constant maturity of 10 years. The word ‘constant’ in the fund name means that the fund is always invested in gilts with 10-year duration. At the end of the maturity period, investors get their initial investment back, which is, at the end of 10 years.Difference between gilt funds and gilt funds with 10 year constant durationGilt Funds invest in a combination of government bonds and debentures that have different maturities. Here, the fund manager invests a major portion of the fund’s corpus in instruments with long or short maturities, depending on the ongoing interest rates.When it comes to 10 year constant gilt funds, the maturity is fixed at 10 years and the funds do not involve active shuffling of maturity duration within the portfolio. While gilt fund managers try to fetch benefits from interest rate movements, this is not the case with 10 year constant gilt funds. Therefore, these funds may be more affected by fluctuating interest rates. Just like gilt funds, 10-year constant duration gilt funds also invest in fixed interest government bonds and securities. In case of a fall in interest rates, 10-year constant duration gilt funds could benefit since the fixed interest rate could be higher than what is available on other debt or equity instruments. On the other hand, these may lose value if interest rates increase, since the fixed interest rate may be lower than the rate offered on other debt or equity instruments. Advantages of a 10-Year Gilt FundGilt mutual funds are safe investments that are government-backed and the investment instruments are issued by the RBI. Here are a few points to highlight the benefits of these funds:Considering lower chances of the government going bankrupt, constant duration gilt funds do not carry much of a credit riskThis makes for a safe long-term investment option with guaranteed returns.Are gilt mutual funds with a 10 year constant duration worth investing?Here are some of the factors that investors can consider before allocating their money to 10 year constant duration gilt funds:These funds are highly sensitive to interest rate movements due to the duration of investment. It is best to invest in these funds when the interest rates are falling or expected to fall further. This is because a fall in interest rates results in higher prices of gilt securities.Investors must also keep a constant eye on the fund’s NAV since these keep moving as per market movements.The expense ratio of these funds is generally based on the fund’s AUM or average assets under management.What is the tax implication of 10 year constant duration gilt funds?When it comes to taxation, returns from 10-year constant gilt funds are treated similar to debt fund returns. For example, if an investor makes a capital gain of Rs. 10,000 from a debt mutual fund investment and withdraws the amount before completion of 3 years from investment, Short Term Capital Gains Tax is applicable as per the investor’s income tax slab rate. To calculate total tax, the earnings from this investment are added to the total taxable income of the investor.If the investor withdraws the gains after 3 years of investment, long-term capital gains tax is applicable at 20% with the benefit of indexation. Indexation helps in reducing the total value of Long Term Capital gains by taking into account the inflation factor on an investment.How to invest in Gilt with 10 year Constant Duration Funds?To invest in these funds, you can download the Fisdom app on your smartphone.
