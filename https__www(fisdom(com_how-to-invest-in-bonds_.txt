A bond is issued by the borrower to raise capital and use it for funding its operations. The investor, against the money lent, earns returns in the form of interest payments. A bond is:a type of fixed-income instrumentits market value changes over timeWhat is a bond agreement? In a loan agreement:the bond issuer promises to pay regular interest to the investor Interest or coupon rate is paid at a predetermined rate Interest is calculated as a percentage of the amount borrowed or face valueThe coupon is paid until a specified maturity date. At the time of bond maturity, the issuer stops the interest payments and repays the principal amount back to the investor. Since the interest payments are made at set intervals and are fairly predictable, bonds come under the fixed-income securities category.Types of bondsBonds can be classified into different types depending on the returns and legal obligations surrounding them. Here are some of the commonly available types:1. Fixed-interest bondsFixed-interest bonds accrue steady coupon rates until maturity. Investors can benefit through predetermined interest rates as returns are predictable, irrespective of fluctuations in market conditions. 2. Floating-interest bondsThe coupon rates on these bonds keep changing throughout the tenure as per market fluctuations. Therefore, the return on investment is inconsistent and is influenced by market factors like inflation, economic situation, investor confidence, etc.3. Inflation-linked bondsInflation-linked bonds are designed to control the inflation impact on the bond’s face value and interest. The coupon rates on these bonds are generally lower as compared to fixed-interest bonds. The idea is to adjust coupons as per prevailing market rates.4. Perpetual bondsAs the name suggests, perpetual bonds pay interest for perpetuity with no maturity period attached. These fixed-security bonds do not require issuers to return the principal amount to the investor. Benefits of investing in bondsSome of the key benefits of investing in bonds are:1. Predictability of returnsInvestors who want to maintain a steady and predictable income level within their investment portfolio should consider investing in high-quality bonds. Such bonds can fetch regular and predictable cash flows while minimising risk of losing the invested capital.2. SafetyBonds may offer some certainty as far as interest earnings and principal repayment are concerned. This depends on the quality of the bond and the credit rating of the issuer.3. DiversificationPortfolio diversification can be achieved by including a mix of asset classes within the portfolio. Fixed-income investments, like bonds added to an equity portfolio, can help in achieving diversification while reducing the overall portfolio risk. With the right level of diversification, an investor can potentially increase portfolio returns in the long run. This is because even if one asset’s value goes down, it still leaves an opportunity to see an increase in another asset class within the portfolio.4. ChoiceThe market is flooded with a number of bond issuers who offer a variety of bonds with different coupon rates and maturity dates. This allows investors to invest in a bond with cash flows that meets their income needs and investment portfolio goals.How are bonds different from stocks?The table below presents the key factors that differentiate bonds from stock investments:FactorsBondsStocksDebt v/s equityBonds are debt instrumentsStocks are equity instrumentsOwnershipBondholders do not enjoy ownership stake in a company and therefore no voting rightsStockholders are considered part owners in a company and enjoy voting rightsShare in profitsNo share in profits of the companyEntitled to get a portion company profitsEarningsEarnings are through interest payments and are fixed, except for floating coupon bonds.Capital appreciation and dividends (if any).
