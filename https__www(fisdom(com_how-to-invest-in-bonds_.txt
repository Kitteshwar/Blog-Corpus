Since the interest payments are made at set intervals and are fairly predictable, bonds come under the fixed-income securities category.Types of bondsBonds can be classified into different types depending on the returns and legal obligations surrounding them. Here are some of the commonly available types:1. Fixed-interest bondsFixed-interest bonds accrue steady coupon rates until maturity. Investors can benefit through predetermined interest rates as returns are predictable, irrespective of fluctuations in market conditions. 2. Floating-interest bondsThe coupon rates on these bonds keep changing throughout the tenure as per market fluctuations. Therefore, the return on investment is inconsistent and is influenced by market factors like inflation, economic situation, investor confidence, etc.3. Inflation-linked bondsInflation-linked bonds are designed to control the inflation impact on the bond’s face value and interest. The coupon rates on these bonds are generally lower as compared to fixed-interest bonds. The idea is to adjust coupons as per prevailing market rates.4. Perpetual bondsAs the name suggests, perpetual bonds pay interest for perpetuity with no maturity period attached. These fixed-security bonds do not require issuers to return the principal amount to the investor. Benefits of investing in bondsSome of the key benefits of investing in bonds are:1.

This is because even if one asset’s value goes down, it still leaves an opportunity to see an increase in another asset class within the portfolio.4.
