Investors can earn income in two forms from ETFs namely, dividend income and capital gains. The tax liability for the income earned from ETFs is mentioned below.

Such dividends were subject to DDT (Dividend Distribution Tax) at the rate of 15% excluding the applicable cess. However, from the financial year 20-21, the dividend earned from ETFs is taxed at the hands of the investors. This income is subject to tax at the applicable income tax slab rates for the investors.  Tax on capital gainsCapital gains are levied at the time of sale or redemption of units of the ETFs. The profit earned through such transactions is subject to the levy of capital gains. Such capital gains are dependent on the type of ETF as well as the period of holding.

DTAA between India and other countries can impact the taxation of index funds and ETFs in India. For example, if an Indian investor invests in an index fund or ETF domiciled in a country with which India has a DTAA, the investor may be eligible for a tax credit on the dividends or capital gains earned from the investment. This can help to reduce the overall tax liability on the investment.Here are some of the key impacts of DTAA on index funds and ETFs in India:Reduced tax liability: DTAA can help to reduce the overall tax liability on index funds and ETFs by providing tax credits on dividends or capital gains earned from investments in countries with which India has a DTAA.Increased investment options: DTAA can increase the investment options available to Indian investors by making it easier to invest in index funds and ETFs domiciled in countries with which India has a DTAA.Improved transparency: DTAA can improve transparency by providing information on the tax treatment of index funds and ETFs domiciled in countries with which India has a DTAA.Overall, DTAA can have a positive impact on the taxation of index funds and ETFs in India by reducing the overall tax liability on investments, increasing the investment options available to Indian investors, and improving transparency.ConclusionETFs and Index funds are relatively new as investment instruments in the Indian market.
