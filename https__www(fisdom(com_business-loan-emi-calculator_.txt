A business will require financial assistance at various stages and for numerous reasons like investment in new plant and machinery, meeting working capital requirements, scaling up the business to new heights, etc. For every such reason, business owners have the option to raise funds through loans or by selling a portion of their equity. When a business loan is issued to any entrepreneur, they have to repay the loan within its tenure through EMIs.Below is the meaning of EMI and the need for an EMI calculator.What is business loan EMI?Any loan given to the business owner for their business is known as a business loan. This loan can be in the nature of a short-term loan or a long-term loan depending on the business requirements. The rate of interest also varies based on its nature and other parameters like the credit score of the applicant, the amount and tenure of loan, lender guidelines, etc.The loan along with the interest component has to be repaid in equal monthly installments over the tenure of the loan which is known as EMI. EMI is calculated on the reducing balance method which means that interest is calculated on the outstanding amount of loan at the beginning of the year. Therefore, as the loan repayment progresses, the interest component keeps reducing and the principal component keeps increasing in the total EMI. This makes it a bit difficult for a layman to understand and derive a number that is not only equal throughout the tenure of the loan but also has the interest and principal amount in the right proportion.How to calculate business loan EMI?As mentioned above, EMI is the payment of a loan in equal installments and it is the combination of interest and principal portion of the loan. The calculation of EMI is based on a standard formula on three main components that form the essence of the loan namely, the amount of loan, the tenure or the period of the loan, and the rate of interest applicable on the loan. Based on these parameters, the mathematical formula for calculating business loans is mentioned below.EMI = P x r x {(1+r)^n/ [(1+r)^n-1]}In the above formula, P represents the loan amount given by the lender.r represents the rate of interest charged by the lender for the loan. For this formula, the rate of interest is considered as a per month rate, therefore, r is calculated as r/12/100.n represents the period or the tenure of the loan and is shown in the form of the total number of months in the tenure (for example, tenure of 10 years is represented as 120 months in the above formula).Let us consider an example to understand the above formula. Company A has applied for a long-term business loan of Rs. 50,00,000 from DEG Bank at the rate of 8% per annum for a tenure of 10 years. The EMI in this example will be calculated as,EMI = 5000000 * 0.006667 * {(1+0.006667)^120 / [(1+0.006667)^120 – 1]}EMI = Rs. Rs. 60,664.What is a business loan EMI calculator?The above calculation shows the exact amount of EMI that has to be paid by the borrower throughout the period of a loan towards the interest as well as the principal loan amount.
