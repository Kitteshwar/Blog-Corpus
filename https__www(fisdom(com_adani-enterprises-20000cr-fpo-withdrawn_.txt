RudriRawellWritten by - Rudri RawellFebruary 2, 2023  6 minutes  In a surprise move and amid the Hindenburg report controversy, Gautam Adani, founder & chairman of Adani Enterprises announced the withdrawal of the company’s Rs.20,000 crore FPO. The company plans to refund investment proceeds to FPO investors, which got bailed out mostly by institutional and foreign investors on the final day of subscription.Here’s why Adani is withdrawing the FPO and what’s at stake.Adani’s surprise FPO withdrawalThe FPO withdrawal comes at a time when the markets are highly volatile. Alongside this, Adani Group stocks are seeing significant decline in price following the Hindenburg Research report. Hindenburg, a research and short-selling company published this report, in which it has accused Adani group of “brazen stock manipulation and accounting fraud”.Adani has assured investors that the group will work with the FPO’s book running lead managers to process refunds to investors. The investment amount will be released in investors’ bank accounts.Did you knowFPO or Follow on Public Offer is also known as secondary offering. It is a process through which a listed company can issue fresh shares to existing and new shareholders for raising additional capital and diversification of its equity base.Why is Adani Enterprises FPO being withdrawn?It is surprising that Adani Enterprises FPO is being withdrawn considering it was subscribed fully by corporates and foreign investors on the final day of the issue subscription.Although the company’s share prices were below the issue price, the FPO was subscribed 1.12 times on the final day of the issue. This was largely subscribed by foreign institutional investors (FIIs) and non-institutional investors (NIIs) including family offices of industrialists and ultra-high networth individuals. The FPO’s QIB portion was subscribed 1.26 times and the portion allocated to NIIs was subscribed 3.32 times. It is important to note that FPO’s retail portion saw a lul response as it was subscribed only 0.12 times. Meaning only 27.45 lakh shares were subscribed against the allotted 2.29 crore shares. Even the employees’ quota was undersubscribed at 55%.In a YouTube video, Adani clarified that he has taken this decision as he believes it is morally correct. This was unexpected by most investors as Adani had been confident about the Follow-on Public Offer’s success, especially considering the institutional boost it received. The backdrop provided for this announcement is that the markets have remained volatile and Adani group’s stock prices had lost up to 10% value by Feb 1. Will FPO withdrawal impact Adani group?Adani Group’s top executive, Mr. Gautam Adani has assured investors and stakeholders that the company’s recent decision to withdraw its follow-on public offering (FPO) will not affect the operations or future plans of any group companies. Adani emphasized that the group will remain focused on delivering projects efficiently and effectively. Adani acknowledged the recent stock market volatility experienced by Adani group companies. He expressed gratitude for the continued trust and support of its investors in the company, its business, and its leadership.Disrupting or deceiving?Adani Group stocks and bonds have been seeing a meltdown ever since the publication of the Hindenburg report. Shares of Adani Enterprises plunged 28% and those of Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone dropped 19%. As Adani group stocks saw a free fall, so did Gautam Adani’s ranking among the world’s richest. From 3rd spot only a month ago, Adani is now struggling to stay on the 15th spot with a drop of $14 billion in his net worth. Mounting debt of Adani groupAccording to reports, Adani group’s debt has doubled to $30 bn in the last 4 years alone. The group’s high leverage levels were also highlighted in the Hindenburg report, which called it ‘extreme leverage’. 5 Adani group companies have a total debt of Rs. 2.1 lakh crores, of which, 40% is from Indian banks. The 5 companies are Adani Green, Adani Ports, Adani Enterprises, Adani Power, and Adani Transmission. Adani enterprises is also said to have a Net Debt-to-Ebitda ratio of 10 times, which is highest among the group’s listed companies. However, bankers who’ve lent funds to the group have stated that the group’s debts are secured by cash flows and assets.What should Adani shareholders do?

The subscription for the FPO closed successfully yesterday. Despite the volatility in the stock over the last week, your faith and belief in the Company, its business and its management has been extremely reassuring and humbling. Thank you.However, today the market has been unprecedented, and our stock price has fluctuated over the course of the day. Given these extraordinary circumstances, the Company’s board felt that going ahead with the issue will not be morally correct.
