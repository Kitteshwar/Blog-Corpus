The investment amount will be released in investors’ bank accounts.Did you knowFPO or Follow on Public Offer is also known as secondary offering. It is a process through which a listed company can issue fresh shares to existing and new shareholders for raising additional capital and diversification of its equity base.Why is Adani Enterprises FPO being withdrawn?It is surprising that Adani Enterprises FPO is being withdrawn considering it was subscribed fully by corporates and foreign investors on the final day of the issue subscription.Although the company’s share prices were below the issue price, the FPO was subscribed 1.12 times on the final day of the issue. This was largely subscribed by foreign institutional investors (FIIs) and non-institutional investors (NIIs) including family offices of industrialists and ultra-high networth individuals. The FPO’s QIB portion was subscribed 1.26 times and the portion allocated to NIIs was subscribed 3.32 times. It is important to note that FPO’s retail portion saw a lul response as it was subscribed only 0.12 times. Meaning only 27.45 lakh shares were subscribed against the allotted 2.29 crore shares. Even the employees’ quota was undersubscribed at 55%.In a YouTube video, Adani clarified that he has taken this decision as he believes it is morally correct. This was unexpected by most investors as Adani had been confident about the Follow-on Public Offer’s success, especially considering the institutional boost it received.
