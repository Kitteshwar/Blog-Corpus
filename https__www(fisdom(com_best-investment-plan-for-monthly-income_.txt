Losing a job, not landing a job soon enough after quitting one, lifestyle costs increasing due to children, and many more. In these situations all we have to rely on are our savings. But as you know, savings can’t always be enough to help you deal with all of your expenses. Therefore it is always better to invest the money you have saved in an investment plan which will help you get monthly income.In addition to that many retired individuals have the fear that their savings may run out soon and they won’t be able to maintain a financially secure life because of the lack of regular income. This is where investment plans for regular monthly income come into play. These plans give you monthly returns that act as your monthly income which you can use for your regular expenses while maintaining your financial security.Best Investment Plans for You to get a Monthly IncomeLet’s go through some of the best investment plans for a monthly income-Post Office Monthly Income SchemeIf you desire to invest in a scheme with zero risk, then Post Office Monthly Income is the safest option for you. This investment scheme is offered by India Post. This investment scheme is backed by the government and hence is a perfect option for the investors who have a low-risk appetite.The post office monthly income scheme has a maturity period of five years with an interest rate of about 6.6% per annum. The investment can be done with a starting amount as low as Rs 1,500 with the maximum amount being 4.5 lakh rupees.Even though the maturity period is five years, the money can be withdrawn anytime between 1 to 5 years. However, withdrawing the money before the maturity period will lead to a deduction of about 1 to 2 %. NBFC Deposits or Corporate Fixed DepositsSimilar to bank deposits, corporate companies like NBFCs or Non-banking financial companies also offer fixed deposits with higher interest rates. These deposits are usually referred to as corporate deposits. As opposed to investing in a bank, you have to invest your money in a corporate firm. These companies will provide you with quarterly or half-yearly interest which are higher than those provided by the bank on your deposits. However, as compared to bank deposits, this investment can be a bit risky and you have to be very careful while choosing the right company to invest in.It is advised to go for a company with high credibility and good financial strength.Senior Citizen Saving SchemeThe Senior Citizen Saving Scheme is a good option for those who are worried about post-retirement income. This scheme offers about 7.4% of interest per annum. Anyone above 60 years of age is eligible to make an investment through this scheme.This again is a risk free scheme with a tenure of 5 years and maximum investable amount of about 15 lakhs. You need to enter this scheme a month prior to your retirement. The one thing to consider is that the income through this scheme is taxable as your monthly income.Government BondsGovernment bonds are the best kind of investment options for the investors who have a low risk appetite. These bonds come with a lock in period that ranges from five to forty years. These are a great option to get maximum returns with low risk. You can also pair them with other investments to attain maximum financial security.Monthly Income Plan or MIPsMutual funds that invest in fixed deposits fall under this category. Monthly income plans are another good option for investment but they come with a moderate risk. The risk here lies with the fund’s performance. As opposed to other schemes, where you get a fixed amount of returns, the amount of returns through MIPs will depend on how well the fund has performed in the market, which might vary from time to time. This also makes your scheme liable to negative returns.Therefore, with MIPs you will have to analyse the fund you plan to invest in and assess your risk profile like you do for any other mutual fund scheme.Annuity PlansAnnuity plans are a great investment option again for post-retirement security. You can invest in a lump sum to earn regular income. Many insurance companies offer annuity plans.
