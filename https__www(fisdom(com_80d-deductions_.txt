However, there are certain basic differences between the two.Mediclaim insurance provides for only hospitalization cover for certain specific diseases and specified amounts. In order to claim mediclaim, hospitalization is essential.Health insurance, on the other hand, can cover the added expenses like preventive health checkups, ambulance expenses, pre-hospitalization, and post-hospitalization expenses.Preventive health checkup to be included under Section 80DIn order to encourage awareness related to periodic health checkups to identify and prevent or cure any serious illness well in advance, the Government of India has given the benefit of a tax deduction on preventive health checkups. Taxpayers can get the benefit of such a deduction of up to Rs.5,000. However, this deduction is to be considered within the specified limit of Rs 25,000 or Rs.50,000 as the case may be. Taxpayers can avail of this deduction even if payment for the same is made in cash.Deduction in case of single premium policiesThe budget of FY 2018 has introduced the benefit of deduction under section 80D in the case of health insurance policies for which premium is paid in a lump sum amount. Eligible premium in such cases can be towards any new policy or keeping an existing policy in force for self, family, children, or parents. The amount of deduction that can be available to the taxpayers, in this case, will be equal to the fraction of the total premium amount. This fraction is derived by dividing the total premium paid by the number of years that the policy will be in effect. What are the documents needed for claiming deduction under Section 80D?Income Tax Act has not specified any documents that have to be submitted for claiming deduction under section 80D. However, it is prudent to keep receipts or records of payments made towards preventive health checkups or for premiums paid towards new health insurance, or keeping an existing policy in force. Taxpayers should ensure that such receipts are in the name of the policyholders.Exclusions from Section 80DThere are certain points that have to be considered by the taxpayer while claiming a deduction under section 80D.
