It is the basis for analysis for the organizations as well as other entities like their competitors, investors, and other stakeholders. Having the necessary data can help organizations optimize their resources as well as make targeted investments and alterations to their business plans and achieve their objectives. But when this important piece of the puzzle is vulnerable, the entire business can crumble within a short span of time and with the increased technology and cyber threats, the need for data security and fallback plans has become paramount. This vulnerability has led to a new stream of insurance, cyber insurance, that has become quite popular in recent times and has attracted many businesses.Cyber insurance is also known as cybersecurity insurance or cyber liability insurance. This insurance is a contract between the insurance provider and its purchaser to ensure a safety net against any financial risks on account of the use of online services and risks of using the ever-changing technology. Cybersecurity insurance is a dynamic form of insurance and hence, the insured party can enhance their coverage depending on their requirements. The premium for this coverage can be paid in flexible formats which can be monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, or annual premium payments as per the agreement between the insurer and the insured party. Features of cyber insurance Protection and coverage against any cyber risks like viruses (intentional or otherwise), cyber threats, and cyber crimes.The coverage for financial and legal costsEnsuring a buffer to the entities (big or small scale businesses) from buckling down due to any cyber attack and loss due to data breach or loss of proprietary information. Cybersecurity insurance plans can be easily purchased online and are often offered by insurers providers that already have a presence in insurance formats like E&O (Errors and Omissions) insurance, business insurance, general insurance, commercial property insurance, etc. Why is cyber insurance important?Cyber insurance is important for any organization that depends on electronic data and internet-based technology to reach their customers as well as ensure smooth operations of their organization. It can protect a company against first-party or third-party liabilities that have resulted on account of any cyber attack and loss of revenue as well as reputation.Cyber insurance can provide coverage or protection against any unauthorized access, cyber extortion, cyberbullying, incidents of data breaches, legal fees for privacy violation cases, repairing and restoring compromised computer systems, etc. Therefore, cyber insurance helps businesses to carry out their operations without the fear of coming to a halt due to cyber threats. The restoration of lost data and bringing normalcy to the business can then be the sole focus of the entities rather than worrying about the financial loss from such vulnerabilities. Who should get cyber insurance? It is a myth that cyber insurance is important for only big organizations that have a huge volume of data. Small organizations are equally vulnerable to cyber attacks if not more. In fact, small businesses and individuals are far more vulnerable to cyber attacks due to the lack of sufficient firewalls and other security measures that are available to business organizations.Therefore, cyber security insurance is a must for everyone, whether they are small or big business organizations or individuals that have a mountain of data stored online. Such data can include customer data, their financial information like credit card or debit cards, personal proprietary information, or sensitive information of the organization, etc. Also Read: How does credit and debit card tokenisation help you?What are the types of cyber insurance coverage offered by insurers? The cyber insurance stream is relatively new to the Indian insurance market.
