Investors can choose an investment option based on many factors. One of the main factors is the risk reward ratio where the investors can assess the returns against the risk of investment. This is particularly helpful to risk-averse investors who want to limit their exposure yet earn decent returns that will help them grow their wealth. For long-term and new investors, a passive investment strategy is ideal. This strategy allows the investors to invest in dynamic investment products that provide higher investment returns than traditional investment products that may be relatively risk-free but also provide lower returns.

Active investment strategy requires an aggressive approach with investments, the returns are higher but the risk is higher as well. The most common example of active investment strategy is mutual funds. Passive investment strategy, on the other hand, is relatively easy-to-monitor strategy.

Some of the prime benefits of passive instruments are mentioned below.Reduced costsThe expense ratio for passive investment products is lower as compared to active investment products. The prime expense for any investment is the fund manager fees which are reduced in the case of passive investment instruments.Simplicity of investmentPassive investment products simply track their underlying index for their performance i.e., they try to match it to the closest level. This tracking is subject to certain errors known as tracking errors. It is the fund manager’s job to reduce such errors to a minimum possible extent and thereby increase the returns. The investment can be made through the fund house or by the investors themselves as per the fund guidelines.Reduced taxesThe taxability of passive investment instruments is lower as compared to active investment products. This is on account of holding the investments for a longer period which may result in reduced capital gains. Less influence of fund managersFund managers do not have an active role in managing the passive funds as compared to actively managed funds. The bias of the fund managers will therefore not affect the performance of the fund.Better transparencyPassively managed funds provide better transparency regarding the underlying assets that form the fund.
