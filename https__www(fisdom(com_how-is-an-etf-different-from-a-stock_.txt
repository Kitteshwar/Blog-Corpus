However, for the average investor, investing in the stock market is still a risky business. It is a high-risk high return scenario which, if not managed properly can result in huge losses to the investors. Owing to this, many investors invest in relatively less risky investment products available in the market other than stocks. One of such unique products is an ETF. Stocks are the individual shares of a company listed on the recognized stock exchange. Investors can purchase any stock of a company in any quantity and can have voting rights or preference over dividends depending on the nature of the stock or share.ETFs or Exchange Traded Funds, on the other hand, are a pool of individual stock or securities that are compiled to form a fund. These assets are usually in the same weightage as the underlying index it tracks for its performance. Similarities between Stocks and ETFsAlthough stocks and ETFs are different investment products, they do have certain similarities.
