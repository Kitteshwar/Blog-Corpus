Tax havens are places or countries that have quite nominal or nil income tax levied on foreign individuals or corporations. The key factor that works in favour of these tax havens is the financial secrecy that they provide to their patrons from tax authorities across the globe. These tax havens do not require individuals or businesses to be physically present or operate in the said country to get benefits of tax havens. This makes it more lucrative as the need to uproot one’s life and business to a tax haven to get tax benefits is eliminated. These countries or places usually charge higher customs duties or import duties to cover for low taxes in their region and gain revenues. Another source of revenue for those tax havens is the fee charged by them to foreign individuals and corporations for registration and license fees. The status of being a tax haven attracts more corporates and foreign individuals which in turn increases their revenues even though it is from marginal taxation. These revenues help the country with its economic development and bring them to the global limelight. Which are the top tax havens in the world? There are many tax havens in the world that have been a good source of tax savings for the elite across the globe. Some of the top tax havens that have traditionally been favoured includeSwitzerland, LuxembourgNetherlandsPanamaCayman IslandsBermudaBritish Virgin Islands Isle of ManMauritius, etc. Tax havens are generally classified into different categories based on the taxes charged by the. The details of the same are provided hereunder. Pure tax havens where there is no income tax or corporate tax and also no capital gains tax. Cayman Islands and Bermuda are classic examples of such tax havens.Tax havens that traditionally provide a preference for offshore and holding companies. Europe’s Luxembourg and Austria are some examples of such tax havens.Tax havens on the basis of lower taxation due to tax agreements between different countries to avoid double taxation. Switzerland, and Ireland, are among the countries with such directions.Tax havens that provide exemptions to export-centric industries set up in the country. Ireland again is on the list of such countries.Tax havens that exempt the taxpayers from paying any cross-border transaction taxes. Panama and Costa Rica are included in this category of tax havens.Tax havens like the British Virgin Islands, and the Bahamas provide special privileges to offshore companies.What are the advantages of tax havens?Some of the key advantages of tax havens are highlighted below. The most obvious advantage of tax havens to the companies is the huge chunk of savings in taxes. These companies route their profits, expenses, and their investments through shell companies that have been established in such tax havens.The tax savings can be utilized in various other avenues like an expansion of business, creating more infrastructure or assets for the businesses, etc. Tax havens charge nominal taxes or registration fees as well as higher import duties and customs duties to offset the loss of lower taxation. However, the lower tax rate as compared to that of the native countries is still feasible for corporates and HNIs which makes them prefer evading tax through tax havens. Host countries get the benefit of regular fixed income in the form of registration fees or license fees that can be utilized for the benefit of their nation.What are the shortcomings of tax havens?While the use of tax havens is quite common, there are a few disadvantages to it as well. Some of such disadvantages are mentioned below.The biggest disadvantage of tax havens is to the nations that lose valuable tax revenues that escape by profits being diverted to tax havens. It is believed that tax havens cost the governments a collective amount of approximately US$ 500 billion to US$ 600 billion per year. The loss of revenue of this magnitude is also the reason that governments cannot undertake drastic reforms for the benefit of the nation and their people. Tax havens contribute to generating black money and are also involved in shady operations through the veil of shell companies. This can create a potentially dangerous situation for countries across the globe. Conclusion Tax havens are technically not wrong in offering lower tax structures to foreign individuals and businesses. As it is legally not wrong, there cannot be a total ban or escape from such tax evasion. Countries therefore should collectively take measures to reduce the dominance of these tax havens as well as to make them less attractive.FAQsTaxes are what keep the wheels of the nation’s economy running.
