The purpose of this network is to securely exchange electronic messages and financial transactions with one another. The SWIFT network enables banks to communicate and exchange financial information. This information can include payment instructions, trade confirmations, and securities transactions with other banks and financial institutions around the globe. Such information can be transferred or shared in a standardized and secure manner. The messages that are transmitted through the SWIFT network are done through a highly secure and reliable network. The network uses encrypted data transmission and authentication methods in order to protect the confidentiality and integrity of the messages being sent.

This system is also known as the SWIFTNet and members of the network can access this system through the internet, permanent leased lines, or through a cloud network. The starting point for the transfer of funds through the SWIFT network is the unique code assigned to each member. This code is an 8 to 11 digit alphanumeric code (similar to an IFSC code) known as the Business Identifier Code (BIC). The code essentially acts as an address for the receiving party to deliver SWIFT messages enabling the fund transfers from the sender entity. A bank or financial institution creates a message using a standardized SWIFT message format. This message includes key details like the sender and recipient’s identity, transaction amount, and payment details. This message is then authenticated and encrypted using secure digital certificates and encryption keys in order to maintain the confidentiality and integrity of the message. Such encrypted message is sent through the secured SWIFT network gateway to the recipient’s bank or financial institution where it is decrypted and authenticated after due verification of the transaction as well as the sender’s details. The message is finally archived in the SWIFT system for record-keeping and audit purposes.Why is the SWIFT system important?The SWIFT System is crucial in today’s world of globalisation for several reasons.
