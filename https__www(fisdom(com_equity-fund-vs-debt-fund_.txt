In most equity funds, at least 65% of the portfolio is made up of investment in equity and equity-related instruments.What are debt mutual funds?Debt mutual funds pool money from investors and invest in debt or fixed-income instruments. Some of the debt investments that these funds aim for are bonds (including corporate bonds), government securities, commercial papers, debentures, treasury bills, and certificates of deposits among others.Difference between equity and debt fundsThe table below highlights the main differences between equity and debt funds:Equity FundsDebt FundsInvestment focusEquity funds mainly invest in stocks that are traded publicly traded. They may also invest in equity-related instruments such as derivatives. Debt funds invest in debt and money market instruments. These aim to earn regular income through interest on such investments. ReturnsEquity fund returns generally offer higher long-term returns than debt funds.Debt fund returns tend to be low or moderate as compared to equity funds.Risk Suitable for investors with a medium to high risk appetite.Suitable for investors with a low risk appetite.Expense ratioActively managed equity funds have relatively higher expense ratios.Debt funds may have comparatively lower expense ratios.Investment horizonSince equity funds are exposed to market volatility, they offer better returns in the long-term as against the short-term.Interest rates may fluctuate and investors must pick specific debt funds based on ongoing interest rates in order to maximise returns.Taxation15% tax is applicable on short-term capital gains from equity funds.

From a long-term perspective, equity returns tend to deliver inflation-beating returns whole debt funds may deliver returns in sync with inflation.Investment objectivesDifferent investors may have different investment objectives, such as regular income generation or long-term wealth creation. Debt funds are suited for investors who prefer regular and stable income. However, those looking for long-term wealth creation should opt for equity funds.DurationDebt funds are suitable for investors who have short-term or medium-term investment horizons whereas equity funds are ideal for longer investment horizons beyond 5 years.RiskIn debt funds, there are very low chances of capital loss, while in equity funds, there is generally a higher risk of capital loss due to price fluctuations. However, in equity funds, the longer the investment period, the lower the variation in returns. TaxabilityEquity investments can be relatively more tax efficient since an investor need not pay any tax on long-term capital gains of under Rs. 1 lakh. Debt funds attract short-term capital gains tax as well as long-term capital gains tax. Thus, if an investor has invested for more than three years, there is no tax difference irrespective of whether invested in equity or debt.ConclusionEquity mutual funds are an ideal investment avenue for beginners who want exposure to the stock market but lack a detailed understanding of the markets. Debt funds can also be included in an investment portfolio to balance the overall risk and return dynamics. Before picking either of these, investors must know the basic features and benefits of each. FAQsWhich is better, active investing or passive investing?Active investing is ideal for investors who prefer to fetch returns from actively managed portfolios and have some level of market know-how.

Passive investing is ideal for beginners who may not have sufficient market know-how and prefer to follow the returns of a benchmark index.In the current high interest rate scenario, will debt funds fetch higher returns?The level of interest earnings from a debt mutual fund will depend on the kind of debt fund one has invested in. In the current scenario, short-term debt funds may fetch higher returns as compared to medium or long-term funds.Should I invest in bank FD or debt mutual fund?A bank FD, although risk-free and stable, fetches lower returns than debt mutual funds. Debt mutual funds also provide investors with a wide range of schemes that one can pick as per investment preference.Can I invest in equity and debt mutual fund at the same time?Yes, you can invest in both equity and debt mutual funds at the same time to ensure appropriate portfolio diversification and balance between risk and returns.Do debt funds come with zero risk?Debt funds, although lower in risk, do carry some level of risk element such as interest rate risk, default risk, etc.Share the article                      Get exclusive content
