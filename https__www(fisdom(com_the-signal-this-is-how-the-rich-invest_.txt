In notion & motion, it is always the learners who become the earners.The year of 2020, even post being unexpectedly different has given expectedly similar results vis-à-vis December’s of years past. In riding through the Covid Crisis, markets have come out super strong breaking All-time highs on an almost daily basis. In fact, in December itself, markets closed 13/14 times in the Green, making new All-Time Highs on 12 out of those occasions!The table below highlights the markets journey from the start of the year to date:After looking at the table above, most investors are asking themselves 1 of the 2 questions:Why didn’t I invest!I did invest…but why did I withdraw earlier!This emotional cry, cause of lacking tries, is what sets the High Net-Worth Individuals (HNI) apart from the retail investors.The statement, often generalized, has drawn merit from highly accoladed cross-border research-oriented individuals and institutions across times.The latest acknowledgment for the same comes from “The Wealth Report 2020” published by Knight Frank. The 14th edition of the report shines light on wealth patterns observed across hierarchical net-worth of clients. The same is shown below:It is aptly clear from the graph above, just how much importance the wealthiest people in the world give to investing. In a financially volatile year like none before, investments across asset classes still contribute 50%+ of a HNI’s portfolio. In encouraging investing amongst the Indian diaspora, RBI conducted a similar wealth distribution study earlier this year. The results of the same are highlighted below:As can be seen, India has a long way to go in catching up with the ways-&-craze for affluence seen in the western sisters. However, it is not all that bad as it appears to be…The govt. in recent past has actively promulgated the idea of shaping India into a more fiscally-savvy body and bank. The sentiment is reflected in the growing millennial foray into financial assets from physical assets. Easing of doing business while simultaneously welcoming digital payment interfaces has incentivized people and policies to augur higher financial inclusion.A direct result of the action has been the growth of online commerce and broking companies. As reference, India saw unparalleled growth of demat accounts in Q1FY20 (24 Lakh – 10% of total live accounts in the country!) as investors looked to capitalized on iceberg-hit prices of titanic-like companies. The latest move in easing norms for FinTech companies to set up their own AMCs is a step-ahead in the direction of India becoming the land of appreciation-&-action.Knight Frank and its survey participants are wary of the same as India is set to cherish one of the highest growth rates in the forthcoming year and similarly over the next 5 years.The table below highlights the same:It is fair to make 2 observations from the comments made in the note so far:Indians are keen to capture the opportunities that markets present before themselvesIndia is designed to be a mine of opportunities in the coming timesWhen the markets open come Monday, make sure you are the first in line to invest. Pro Tip – with the fisdom app, you can be investment-ready in less than 5 minutes.
