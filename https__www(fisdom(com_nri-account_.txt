This is because they can have income sources, both, in India as well as their country of residence. Therefore, the products and services offered by banks for such customers are specific and based on the needs of NRIs. One such banking product is the NRI account.   Let’s have a look at the concept of an NRI account, its features, eligibility criteria and other pertinent information.NRI or Non Resident IndianAn Indian citizen or Person of Indian origin who stays out of the country is referred to as ‘Non Resident Indian’ (NRI). A person who is employed for a company based outside India will be deemed NRI immediately.    From a taxation point of view, individuals need to satisfy any of the following conditions for identifying their status as ‘Resident Indian’ :    If they were in India for a period of 182 days or more during previous Financial Year,  or They were in India for a period of 60 days or more during the previous FY and 365 days or more during the four years immediately preceding the previous year   In case these conditions are not satisfied, the person is considered as a Non Resident Indian. What is an NRI AccountNon Resident Indian or Person of Indian Origin (PIO) can own and operate a bank account in India, which is known as an NRI account. This account can be a savings, current or deposit account and can be used by NRIs for saving and investing their earnings from India or abroad.

When opening an NRI account at a branch office, one needs to submit the same documents, along with a copy of the applicant’s overseas address and income proof. Once the documents have been verified, the applicant’s NRI account will be opened.Types of NRI accountsThere are three types of NRI accounts offered by banks :  1. Non – Resident Ordinary Account (NRO)NRIs can operate Non Resident Ordinary (Rupee) accounts for receiving and managing their income arising in India.
