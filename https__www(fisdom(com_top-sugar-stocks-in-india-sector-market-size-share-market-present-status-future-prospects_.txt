Apart from being in the top 3 in terms of sugar production in the world, India is also the largest consumer of sugar in the world. Therefore, the future projections for the sugar industry look quite bullish even in the face of market uncertainty due to the ongoing war and the pandemic.Given below is a brief analysis of the sugar sector in the country and related details of the same.Sector overviewThe sugar industry is the second largest agro-based industry in India. It is also a huge contributor to the employment sector in the country with approximately 12% of the overall employment opportunities in rural India. India is the largest sugar-producing country in the world and contributes approximately 20% of the global supply of this commodity. There are 9 top sugar-producing states in the country which include Maharashtra, Gujarat, Bihar, Andhra Pradesh, Haryana, Karnataka, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, and Tamil Nadu. Among these states, Maharashtra is considered to be the top sugar-producing state in the country. The production of sugar includes 80% from sugarcane extraction and 20% from sugar beet. In India, the majority of sugar is produced through sugarcane. Sugar production is quite volatile and has a direct impact on its prices. The factors responsible for the production and supply of sugar include Heavy dependence on the monsoonDelay in payment to the farmers that drive them away from the crop to other crops,An increase in the drought conditions that further drives the farmers away from the water-intensive sugarcane crop,Government makes various policies and initiatives to boost sugar production and stabilize the prices in the domestic market.Government initiativesThe government has time and again taken many decisions and policy initiatives to boost sugar production, provide the necessary assistance to the farmers as well as ensure that the prices of this commodity are in a manageable range. Some of the initiatives taken by the government include the following.The government has levied an import duty of 100% and eliminated the export duty of 20% to boost the exports and reduce the dependence of the country on imports to meet its demands.The government has increased the MSP (Minimum Selling Price) by 7% to ensure fair prices to the farmers for their produce. Other government initiatives include the issue of soft loans to the tune of Rs. 12,900 crores to the sugar mills for the production of ethanol.Another soft loan is up to the amount of Rs. 10,540 crores are intended to help the mills in clearing the rising arrears to cane growers. The government has also initiated the Ethanol Blended Petrol Programme and directed the oil marketers to target a 10% blending of ethanol with petrol.The government has also initiated a Private Entrepreneurs Guarantee Scheme for the construction of storage godowns in association with private players. The total sanctioned capacity under this project is 152.40 LMT and up to 144.50 LMT has been already completed as of 30th September 2020.Factors driving growth in the sugar industryThere are many factors that drive the growth of the sugar industry in the country. Some of the key factors contributing to the same are discussed below.The sugar sector has seen growth in overall consumption at an average CAGR of 3%.Ethanol is a by-product in the sugar industry in the form of molasses. When this ethanol is blended with petrol, it produces a cheaper and cleaner source of energy. To promote this, the government has set a target of blending 10% ethanol under the EBP by 2022 and 20% by the end of 2025. This has given a huge boost to the sugar industry as they can use the surplus ethanol production under the EBP program and also enjoy the higher margins for the same. Another market driver for the sugar industry is the increase in consumption in the confectionery segment by an average CAGR of 6.35% (between 2021 and 2025). As sugar accounts for approximately 25% of the raw material in this segment, it is another driving factor for the growth in the sugar industry.The final segment or contributor in the sugar industry is the increasing demand for soft drinks.
