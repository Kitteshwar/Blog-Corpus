Declining crude oil inventories in U.S., tighter supplies from OPEC, and rising govt. taxes are primary drivers of increasing oil prices.Apart from raw materials, there is also an increase in labour prices due to labour shortage. While the demand force in the economy remains weak currently, it’s the supply-side factors which can put upward pressure on inflation going forward.Core inflation also saw broad-based increase, marking a multi-year high at 6.6%.
