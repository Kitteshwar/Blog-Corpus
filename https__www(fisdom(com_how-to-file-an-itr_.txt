Happiness is of two forms. The first one is the internal happiness which you gain from charity and other social cause. The other one is the external happiness which you gain from spending money. He told me you can’t get both kinds of happiness at the same time. Well, the monk hasn’t met the older monk yet. Politely, I bowed my head and whispered, “I am sure you aren’t aware of the concept of Income Tax”.Allow me to get to the point, how to file an ITR?To be honest, ITR filing is quite a cumbersome task.
