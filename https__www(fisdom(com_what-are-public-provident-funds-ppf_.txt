The future is a treasure box of unseen mysteries. Old age can also be unpleasant due to uncertain events like health issues or unexpected emergencies. If you want to be prepared for that, it’s vital that you back your retirement age with an assured income to meet all your needs, both planned and unplanned. There are various schemes that help you create a good corpus to keep you prepared for your golden days to come. One such scheme is our topic for discussion today–“Public Provident Fund”Let us understand more about Public Provident Fund (PPF).What does PPF mean?On July 1, 1968, the Central Government of India introduced a voluntary investment scheme called Public Provident Fund that would assure income security for resident Indians (both salaried and self-employed) during their retirement. The PPF rate for July-September 2021 (Q1 FY21) is 7.1%. However, the Indian Government revises these rates every quarter.Why should you invest in PPF?Here are the top reasons why you can consider investing in PPF:PPF provides assured returns during your old age, thereby ensuring financial security.PPF is highly reliable and risk-free since it is a Government scheme that ensures capital protection.Helps you deal with inflation, provided the inflation rate is below the interest rate provided by PPF. Additionally, the Government reviews the PPF rates quarterly.PPF provides tax deduction of an investment amount up to Rs. 1.5 lakhs under Section 80C of the Income tax act. Any withdrawals, maturity amount, interest earned, and deposits are completely tax-free.Do PPF investments offer liquidity?Though PPF has stringent lock-in period and withdrawal protocols, it still provides liquidity:The entire amount can be withdrawn only after the PPF tenure (15-year lock-in period). However, loans are offered against the PPF from the third to the sixth year.Premature closure of PPF takes place in the event of the account holder’s death only. However, to support the needs of medical emergencies or cater to children’s higher education, PPF also allows early closure of accounts after 5 financial years of account opening.To provide cover in cases of financial crises, partial withdrawals are permitted. Such withdrawals are allowed once a year, from the 6th financial year onwards and are subject to conditions such as:withdrawals must not exceed 50% of the balance at the end of the fourth year, or50% of the balance at the end of the immediately preceding year, whichever is lower.The major objective of a PPF account is to create long-term savings because the minimum investment tenure is 15 years. In this case, investing in Mutual Funds makes more sense because you can have chances of earning higher returns as compared to 7.1% from PPF. Some of the funds that have historically given more than 15% returns for a 5-year investment are:Nippon Focused Equity Fund–Returns > 15.62%IIFL Focused Equity Fund–Returns > 19.23%Axis Focused 25 Fund Direct Plan Growth–Returns > 18.76%At the same time, liquidity is also a crucial factor for investment. After all, it is your money and you must be able to access it when there is a need or an emergency. If you have objectives that need a smaller time period, then you can invest your savings in Short Duration Mutual Funds.Here are some short-term funds (between 1- 3 years) that provide average returns of more the 8% combined with easy liquidity:Kotak Bond Short Term Fund – Returns > 8.37% (2-year average)IDFC Bond Fund – Returns > 8.78% (3-year average)Axis Short Term Fund Direct Growth – Returns > 8.47% (2-year average)What are the eligibility criteria for a PPF?You are eligible to open a PPF account if you are a resident of India.
