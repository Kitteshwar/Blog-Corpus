It acts as additional support for the policyholder to bear medical expenses in the future when he/she needs to use the health insurance. Most insurance companies offer a no-claim bonus of 5% or more on the sum assured. Those insurers who do not provide a no-claim bonus mostly give rebates on the premium or offer cumulative benefits.Types of No Claim Bonus in health insurance:No claim bonus is commonly offered to eligible policyholders by private and public sector insurance providers in India. There are two different types of no claim bonuses in India:Cumulative Benefit – Under this type, instead of discount policyholders can get an increase in the sum insured. Policyholders are rewarded for not raising a claim with an addition to the sum insured during policy renewal. Understanding through an example – Nitin does not make a claim for his Rs. 5,00,000 health policy. At the time of renewing the plan, his insurer offers a 10% addition to his sum insured . This makes the total sum insured Rs. 5,50,000. If he does not make a claim in the next year too, the cumulative benefit will result in the sum insured becoming Rs. 6,00,000.Some insurers may cap the cumulative benefit limit to 50%. This means the additional sum insured cannot go beyond 50% of the original value. Continuing the example, Nitin’s sum insured can rise up to Rs. 7,50,000 for five consecutive claim-free years. After reaching this amount, his bonus benefit will cease.Discount on Premium – This option offers a discount on the premium payable during policy renewal in case no claim is made during a policy year. Policyholders can therefore continue their health insurance at a discounted rate.Understanding through an example – Nitin has a policy with a sum insured of Rs. 5,00,000 and a premium amount of Rs. 5,000. If no claim is raised during the policy period, the insurer will offer him a discount of 10%. Thus, Nitin pays only Rs. 4,500 for plan renewal and saves Rs. 500.Features of no claim bonusFew noteworthy features of no claim bonus in a health insurance are:No claim bonus offered by most Indian insurers is between 5 to 20% of sum assured.In case a policyholder wishes to switch to a different health insurance company, the accumulated no claim bonus remains active.No claim bonus amount added to the sum insured can be availed by a family member if covered within a Family Floater policy.Benefits of no claim bonus (NCB)No claim bonus in health insurance plans benefits policyholders as mentioned below:Additional sum insuredWith increasing medical expenses, an individual’s existing health policy may be inadequate in meeting the rising healthcare costs.
