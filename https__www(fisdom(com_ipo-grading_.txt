The idea was to help investors in assessing the issue before taking an investment decision.

If an issuing company gets a higher score, it indicates stronger fundamentals and the company can therefore command a premium for the IPO issue.Which factors influence IPO grading?IPO grading encompasses both internal and external factors surrounding the issuing company. Internal factors primarily include the management competence, promoters’ profile, company’s marketing strategies, competitive advantage, growth prospects, technological initiatives, operational efficiency, liquidity, asset quality, accounting ability, and hedged risks, etc. External factors comprise the industry scenario combined with the economic situation or the business environment of the company.

The IPO rating cannot be rejected by the issuing company.Should I subscribe safely to an IPO issue with IPO grade that is above average or strong fundamentals?An IPO grade is in no way a suggestion or recommendation to subscribe to an IPO issue.
