The maximum limit is Rs 5 lakhs per bank account.If the net deposit amount held by an individual in one bank exceeds Rs 5 lakhs, then he/she can avail only Rs 5 lakhs, including principal and interest amount. This is, in case the bank goes bankrupt.DICGC provides deposit insurance to all depositors of commercial banks and foreign banks that operate in India. It covers state, central and urban co-operative banks, local area banks and regional rural banks. The bank must have bought the cover from DICGC for the insurance to be applicable to its depositors.In case a bank fails or does not allow withdrawal of deposits, customers can claim the insurance cover of up to Rs. 5 lakhs and withdraw within this limit depending on the amount they have deposited with a bank.Increased limit on bank deposit insuranceAs per the latest announcements made by the Finance Minister of India, in case a bank fails or does not allow investors to make withdrawals due to any financial pressure, the depositors can get immediate access to their deposits up to the deposit insurance amount of Rs 5 lakhs.In the recent past, many banks have faced financial stress and passed on the hardship to their depositors (for example, YES Bank and PMC Bank). The insurance cover on bank deposits has now been raised from Rs 1 lakh to Rs 5 lakhs.

The maximum coverage is Rs 5 lakhs for all accounts. For those who have more than one account with the same bank (even if different bank branches) the insurance limit still remains Rs 5 lakhs.Deposit insurance coverage limit is applicable separately to different deposits in different banks. For example, if a person has an account with SBI and HDFC Bank, both the bank accounts will be separately insured for up to Rs 5 lakhs each.Status of joint accounts under bank deposit insuranceBoth single and joint accounts are separately covered under the DICGC bank deposit insurance scheme. If an individual has a savings account that is operated solely by himself/herself and another account jointly operated with the spouse, both will be covered under the scheme. In case the bank fails, both the accounts are considered as separately insured under the deposit insurance scheme.Is there a guaranteed insurance cover for all bank deposits?Many bank accounts do not enjoy bank account insurance cover since banks do not register for the same with DICGC. As per the latest RBI report, nearly 49% of all bank deposits in India are not covered under the Rs. 5 lakhs insurance cover. The failure to register is mostly observed among co-operative and local area banks. To ensure that one’s bank deposit is protected, an investor should check if the bank is registered with the insurance provider and accordingly make a choice to deposit with the bank.ConclusionBank deposit insurance scheme aims to bring down the risk associated with bank failures or bankruptcy.
