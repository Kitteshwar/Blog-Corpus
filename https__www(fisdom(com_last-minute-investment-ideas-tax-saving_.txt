Using Section 80C for last minute investment planning Section 80C of the Income Tax Act is one of the most popular widely explored options for tax saving investments. With a host of financial investments options ranging from PPF, EPF, ELSS, Life Insurance Policy premiums, Bank FDs, Post Office Schemes etc. There is some or the other investment option available for all types of investors. Investments up to Rs 1.5 lakh in one or more of these are exempt from tax. Here is a quick review of some of the best last minute investment options in Section 80C.PPF:  If you unsure about where to invest and don’t want to take risks for your investments, invest in PPF. PPF investments are backed by government and offer fixed interest rate each year. If you do not have a PPF account, you can open one online and if you have an account then you can just invest the remaining amount to utilize your 80C limit. However, the current rate of interest is low at 7.6% p.a.ELSS: ELSS is one of the best investment options in the list of financial products as it provides you the opportunity to invest in markets and enjoy tax deductions for the same. If you are a salaried employee, a sizeable amount of your investments go into your EPF account and you can look at investing in ELSS to diversify your portfolio into equities. Even for non-salaried taxpayers, ELSS is the ideal option for equity investment as most of the investments in 80C are debt investments. Another advantage of ELSS is that it has the shortest lock-in period of 3 years. Among all investment options, ELSS mutual funds offer the lowest lock-in with almost the highest returns.Life insurance policy: Having a life insurance policy is extremely essential and if you do not have insurance policy with adequate coverage then you should look at buying a good term insurance policy. One should have term insurance policy in the portfolio to protect family for uncertainties.NPS: You should start your retirement planning as soon as you can and NPS can be a great investment avenue for the same. Your investments in NPS enjoy additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under Section 80 CCD(1b) thus taking the total limit of tax deductible u/s 80C income to Rs 2,00,000 for the financial year.Unit Linked Insurance Plan (ULIP): A Unit Linked Insurance Plan (ULIP) is a financial product that combines both investment and insurance in one package. ULIPs offer the opportunity to build wealth while also providing life insurance coverage.With a ULIP, a portion of the invested amount is allocated towards life insurance, while the remaining amount is invested in a mix of equities, debt, or a combination of both. This type of investment is suitable for long-term financial goals such as saving for your child’s college education, retirement, or other significant financial milestones.ULIP premiums are eligible for a tax deduction under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act, up to a maximum of Rs. 1.5 lakh per year. Additionally, the returns earned on a ULIP policy are exempt from income tax under Section 10(10D) upon maturity.Deduction on your Housing Loans: You can claim repayment of principal amount of your home under Section 80C upto Rs 1.5 lakh. Apart from this, you can also claim additional deduction of Rs. 2 lakhs on the interest component of your home loan for fully constructed self-occupied property under Section 24(b).Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana (SSY): This is a savings scheme initiated by the government to promote the development of the girl child. Parents can open an account with a minimum investment of Rs. 250 and a maximum of Rs. 1.5 lakh per financial year. The government announces the interest rate every quarter. The scheme offers tax benefits, including a tax exemption of up to Rs. 1.5 lakh per year under Section 80C, exemption from tax on interest earned, and tax exemption on the total amount at maturity. It is an EEE (Exempt-Exempt-Exempt) scheme, which means the investment, interest earned, and maturity amount are all tax-exempt.National Savings Certificate (NSC): This is a savings scheme supported by the Indian Government. You can open an account at any post office in India, and the investment is locked for five years. After five years, you get the full amount. You can invest up to Rs. 1.5 lakh per year, and you can also avail tax deductions on investments under Section 80C. The NSC can be a good option for those who want guaranteed returns and save tax at the same time.Tax-saving FDs: These are similar to regular FDs, but offer a tax break on investments up to Rs. 1.5 lakh under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act. They have a lock-in period of 5 years, and cannot be redeemed before maturity without penalty. Any Indian resident can open a tax-saving FD with a minimum investment of Rs. 1,000. This is a low-risk investment option suitable for long-term investment with guaranteed returns. The interest earned on tax-saving FDs is taxable.Tax saving beyond Section 80CSection 80C is not the only option available for tax saving in India. There are other sections under the Income Tax Act that provide tax benefits and can be used for tax-saving purposes. Some of the popular tax-saving options apart from Section 80C are:Medical policy premiums: With healthcare costs on the rise, having a medical insurance policy is crucial. You can claim a tax deduction on the premium paid for such policies for yourself, your spouse, children, or parents under Section 80D.Interest on education loan: If you have taken an education loan for higher studies for yourself, your spouse or children, you can claim a tax deduction on the interest paid on such loans each year under Section 80E.Donations made to funds and charitable organizations: Donations made to charitable trusts, organizations, or relief funds can be claimed as tax deductions under Section 80G.Interest earned on your savings account: You can claim a tax deduction of up to Rs. 10,000 for interest earned on your savings account under Section 80TTA. For senior citizens, the limit is Rs. 50,000 per year.Practical guide for effective tax-saving investmentsMany people wait until the last quarter of the financial year to start thinking about their taxes. But this can lead to poor investment decisions. The best strategy is to start planning at the beginning of the financial year. This gives you more time to make informed investment choices and stay invested for a longer period, which can help you reach your financial goals quickly.Here are some practical steps to help you plan your tax-saving investments:Check if any of your investments or expenses during the year are eligible for tax deductions. For example, contributions to EPF, home loan repayments, and school fees can be tax-deductible.Identify your investment goals and your risk profile to help you select the best investment options.Invest the appropriate amount to reach your financial goals while also taking advantage of tax-saving opportunities.ConclusionIn conclusion, many taxpayers tend to make hasty investment decisions by only relying on 80C tax-saving options, resulting in poor financial decisions. However, by exploring other options such as 80D, 80E, and others, taxpayers can benefit from long-term wealth creation. The article highlights some of the last-minute tax-saving investment tips that can help individuals reduce their tax liability.
