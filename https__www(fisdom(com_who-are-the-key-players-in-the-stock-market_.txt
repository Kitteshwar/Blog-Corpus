India has two main stock exchanges NSE and BSE where huge volumes of securities are traded during normal market hours. These stock exchanges are run and regulated as per the rules and regulations laid down by SEBI. The companies that are listed on these stock exchanges have to abide by all the provisions of the Companies Act, 2013 as well as SEBI.Depository and Depository ParticipantsThe shares held by investors in the early 90s were in paper format. They were issued share certificates from the company stating the number of shares held by them, their face value, and the value of the investment. These share certificates were then digitized and held or deposited in a secure vault known as the Demat account. This is where the depositories come into the picture. Their role is to be the intermediary between the stock exchange and investors and keep their digitized shareholdings in a secure account. They can also be known as defacto banks for securities. Depository participants on the other hand are the intermediaries between the depository and investors. Investors cannot directly deposit their shares and other securities into their Demat account. They will need a depository participant who is a registered agent that acts on behalf of investors and deposits the shares and other securities that are held in the dematerialized form with the depository. Watch this video on YouTubeStockbrokersStockbrokers are the link between the stock exchange and investors.

Stockbrokers can be individuals, companies, partnership firms, banks, etc. BanksBanks are the custodians of funds or the channels that are used to transfer funds from one account to another or from a bank account to a trading account or vice versa. Investors need to link their Demat account and trading account to their valid and active bank account as part of their KYC too. InvestorsInvestors are an important key to all the activities in the stock markets, They are the ultimate consumers who invest in stock markets or trade in different securities.
