Centre not keen on trimming budgetary capex target for FY23  The central government has no plans to curtail capital expenditure (capex) plans for 2022-23. Various infrastructure ministries have been directed to ensure that they realize their capex goals and create durable assets during the fiscal. For 2022-23, the government has budgeted a capex of Rs.7.50 trillion.The Centre’s capex in April 2022 rose by 67.5 per cent as compared to same month a year ago, on the back of robust spending by the ministries of road transport and railways and the department of defence services.2. Auto companies report healthy domestic sales in May 2022 as demand remains firm  Major car manufacturers such as Maruti Suzuki, Hyundai and Tata Motors reported robust domestic dispatches in May 2022 on the back of a strong demand for passenger vehicles across regions, in spite of global semiconductor shortage continuing to impact production.Commercial vehicle sales continued their upward trajectory on the back of a steady demand from the infrastructure and e-commerce segments.
