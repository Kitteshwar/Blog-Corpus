In the future, the domestic aviation industry is expected to be the fastest-growing origin-and-destination market globally as per RPK metrics or revenue passenger kilometre metrics. The sector will likely grow at an average yearly rate of 9.5%. Some of the factors that are currently driving the growth in the Indian aviation sector are:Strong market potentialThe aviation industry is expected to see increasing passenger traffic in the domestic market, scaling up by almost 12.8% each year. Passenger capacity requirement in the domestic sector, as per the ASK metric or Available Seat Kilometers, may rise by an average of 10.7% annually. With this rising market potential, airlines will also have to ramp up their capacity. Preference for flights over trainsThe Indian middle class is one of the major contributors to the aviation industry, as air travel offers far more convenience when compared to rail and road travel. Thus, one of the major growth drivers in the aviation sector is more people preferring flights over trains for their travel. Currently, domestic airlines have the capacity to carry only 610 lakh passengers annually. It is expected that crores of passengers will soon be opting-out of train travel and switching to airline travel as their disposable incomes will rise. Population sizeIndia’s middle class is growing and the number of households in this segment is expected to reach almost 15 crores in the next 5 years. Additionally, some of the country’s metro cities, including Mumbai and New Delhi, could attain the 25th and 30th ranks respectively among the largest cities in the world, as measured by disposable household income. For the airline industry, more household income and more population will only mean more business.Rising tourismPeople are travelling domestically and internationally more than ever before. If statistics are to go by, close to 7.7 million passengers travelled in February 2022 alone. The airline industry is seeing a growth rate of 9.36% in domestic air traffic. (Source – Zeenews)Did you knowWith the current pace of growth being witnessed in the Indian aviation industry, the sector may likely become the 3rd largest in the world by 2030. Growth drivers in aviation sectorDespite the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, the Indian aviation sector began reviving in 2021 as domestic flight operations came back to pre-covid days. After the international services restarted, the growth trajectory has since been on an upward trend.Quote-UnquoteAs per Union Minister of Aviation, Jyotiraditya Scindia, “India is looking at tremendous expansion. Expansion in the area of airlines, expansion in the area of airports. And therefore, fleet augmentation is also important. A country that had a fleet of only 400 aircraft in the year 2013-14 has grown to a fleet of 710 aircraft in the last seven years, an addition of almost 310 aircraft. And we intend to add at least 110 to 220 aircraft per year as we go forward,”The sector is also seeing many integrations, new launches and mergers for accelerated growth. For instance, Air India was sold to the Tata Group and a new airline called Akasa Air is slated to be launched by the ace investor Rakesh Jhunjhunwala. With the introduction of a new airline, there is likely to be fresh competition and changing dynamics in the Indian aviation sector. Increasing privatisation of airports across India is also one of the growth drivers that is infusing healthy competition in the sector. Many large private players are now entering this space to enhance their business profiles and attain growth. Road-blocks in the aviation sector growthSome of the hurdles that the aviation sector is facing in its growth trajectory are:CompetitionWith multiple airlines trying to get a larger market share out of the Indian aviation sector, there are only a few that have price-sensitive models like IndiGo airlines. It is one of the few that has showcased consistent performance and remained profitable over the years. Experts are awaiting the launch of Akasa airlines and the performance of Air India after its take-over by the Tata group to see how the future competition will shape up and influence the industry’s growth.Rising pressure of pricesIt is not easy to survive in the Indian aviation industry as airlines often struggle to keep up with the pricing pressures. While fuel prices have been rising, the airlines have not been able to fully pass on the cost burden to passengers since they are known to be extremely price sensitive. As airlines keep the prices low to attract more passengers, the only possible hope is profitability through economies of scale. Top stocks in the Indian aviation sectorInterGlobe Enterprises LimitedInterGlobe Enterprises Limited is into aviation management, hotel development and management, and travel-related services.
