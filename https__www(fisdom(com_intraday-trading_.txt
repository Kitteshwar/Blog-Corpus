This type of trading can be done in any market, however, it is most commonly done in the stock and foreign exchange markets. In intraday trading, all positions are squared-off or settled before the market closure for the day. Thus, these trades do not result in a change of ownership of traded shares.What are the differences between intraday trading and regular trading?A striking difference between a regular trade and an intraday trade is to do with taking the delivery of stocks. Since intraday trading positions are squared-off on the same day, a trader’s sell order is offset with another’s buy order.
