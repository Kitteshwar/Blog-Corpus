Mid-cap funds are mutual funds that invest primarily in mid-cap companies, i.e., companies that are ranked between 101 to 250 in terms of market capitalization. These companies are considered to be relatively riskier than the blue-chip companies or large-cap companies but the returns generated are also relatively higher. What are small-cap funds?This is the final category of mutual funds when classified based on the market capitalization of the companies. Small-cap funds invest predominantly in companies that are ranked beyond 250 in terms of market capitalization. These funds belong to the high-risk high returns category and can be included in the portfolio to boost the overall profitability of the market. Who are the target investors?Volatility on stock markets cannot be ignored and the stocks in every segment react to such volatility in their own capacity. Large-cap stocks are relatively stable and hence, they do not react much to price volatility. This also gives little margin for gains based on speculations. Mid-cap stocks and small-cap stocks are quite volatile their ability and degree of reaction to price fluctuations make it a perfect opportunity to generate higher returns. However, this also implies that the funds that invest in these stocks are ideal for investors with a relatively higher risk appetite. Also, these funds may face volatility in the short term but the average period of investment for mid-cap and small-cap funds are 4 to 5 years and 10to 12 years respectively. What are the points to consider for investment in small-cap and mid-cap funds?Small-cap funds and mid-cap funds have seen a tremendous rally in the post-pandemic period. The highs that markets have seen after the initial crash led by the pandemic have made the stocks in these categories make up for the lost ground. However, there are a few points that need to be considered while investing in small-cap and mid-cap funds. Some of these factors are mentioned below.Investment in small-cap and mid-cap funds lacks the liquidity of large-cap funds hence, it may make a timely exit from the markets difficult. The potential for growth in these funds is higher as compared to the large-cap fund segment. The risks of the small-cap and mid-cap funds include the inherent risks, risk of market fluctuations which can eliminate the potential of earning higher returns from this category of funds.It is important to stay invested for a longer duration to maximize the gains for any investor in small-cap and mid-cap funds.

That said, it is also important to note that the post-pandemic period has seen some of the major recoveries in these segments. This is backed by various reasons like the government support to the MSME sectors, the relief packages announced in the face of Covid 19, the favourable market sentiment. While small-cap and mid-cap funds can be attractive investment options, it is imperative that investors have a balanced equity portfolio based on your risk appetite. Investors should also focus on quality funds from the small-cap and mid-cap category which invest in top companies in these segments. Having a long-term approach to small-cap and mid-cap funds is crucial to having a successful portfolio along with ignoring the noise of short-term volatility. If the objective of the fund and the risk-reward parameters of the fund matches that of the investors, small-cap funds and mid-cap funds are an excellent addition, or as most experts believe, a crucial part of every portfolio. ConclusionThere is no ideal time of investment for small-cap funds or mid-cap funds.

At the same time, the benefit of compounding is also available to investors.
