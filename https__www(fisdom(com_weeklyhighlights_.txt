He further stated that even if India does not sustain this growth rate and slows down to four to five per cent during 2040-50, it would become the largest economy in the world after China by 2060. With a view to reach the milestone, Patra has suggested to focus on four drivers of growth including demographic dividend, manufacturing, exports and internationalisation of the rupee.Demographics, manufacturing, exports and internationalisation are the four engines that can power India to achieve escape velocity from the emerging economy orbit and take off towards becoming an economic superpower, according to MD Patra, Deputy Governor, Reserve Bank of India (RBI).
