Along with the US, the other central banks like Australia, Europe signaled to ease their monetary policies to support economic growth.Gold buying by major central banks:Global Central Banks, especially of countries having exposure to America’s unexpected policies, seem to be loading up on their gold reserves as a hedge against any major economic headwinds they may face.Bottom line:Gold as an asset class is known to be a natural hedge to economic risks your portfolio may be exposed to. While this short-term gleam in gold prices does not warrant an out and out investment into gold, it sure strengthens the case for a diversified asset allocation into equity, debt, and gold.It makes sense for investors to hold an indicative ~5%-10% of the total portfolio in gold mutual funds or digital gold to maintain a well-diversified portfolio that will help build a consistent, sustainable and risk-optimal portfolio for the longer term.
