Especially when it comes to TDS on mutual fund investments, investors are often perplexed about the net in-hand returns they receive versus what they expected. Types of returns from mutual fund investmentsMutual funds investors can expect returns in two main formats, dividend income and capital gains. Dividends are portions of profits paid out by the company, if any. When companies have surplus cash, the same may be distributed to investors in the form of dividends. The dividend amount is based on the number of mutual fund units held by investors.A capital gain is what an investor earns from sale of the mutual fund units held by him/her. If the sales proceeds are greater than the investment amount, there is capital gain. A gain is realised from a mutual fund investment if the price of units is higher at the time of sale as compared to the price at the time of investment. Investors must pay tax on both dividend and capital gains income.
