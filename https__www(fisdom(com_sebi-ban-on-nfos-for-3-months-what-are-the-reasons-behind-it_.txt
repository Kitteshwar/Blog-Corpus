RudriRawellWritten by - Rudri RawellApril 1, 2022  6 minutes  Asset management companies in India have been informed by SEBI to halt the launch of any new fund offers in the next three months. This comes in line with the market regulator’s earlier warning to the mutual fund industry regarding compliance with various norms on funds being pooled by distributors and other intermediaries. Until now, brokers and other mutual fund distributors that helped investors make mutual fund investments were able to pool funds into their accounts before transferring them to the fund houses or clearing corporation.

The directive stated that any funds pooled for mutual fund investment should directly go from an investor’s account to the mutual fund. Post this directive, the industry sought additional time to implement moves that comply with the new expectations. Therefore, the deadline for the implementation of the rule was extended.What does SEBI expect from AMCs?SEBI’s initial directive around pooling of funds came In October 2021, and it was followed by additional clarifications in March 2022. As part of this directive, the regulator asked fund houses to various intermediaries, like stockbrokers, investment advisors, mutual fund distributors, etc stop the usage of pooled accounts to collect funds and mutual fund units on behalf of investors. This ruling is believed to be a result of the aftermath of Karvy Stock Broking’s fallout.What is pooling of funds? Fund pooling acted as a wallet held by intermediaries. Through this, funds were being collected from investors and mutual fund units for investment or redemption were passed on to investors. To put it simply, an investor’s money would first go to the intermediary’s pooled account once he/she made a fund purchase request. The broker would then credit the investor’s money to the fund house. Thus, the investor’s money was effectively being passed through an intermediary.Risks involved in fund poolingTo protect investor interest and eliminate the risk of fund diversion by intermediaries, SEBI mandated mutual fund houses to prohibit such pool accounts or fund pooling accounts. According to the regulator, this will ensure a smooth and direct flow of funds and mutual fund units between fund houses and investors. Two-factor authenticationFor enhanced risk mitigation, the regulator instructed fund houses to have a two-factor verification for authenticating transactions related to online fund unit redemption and verifying source details of the bank accounts.Here is an example to understand this mechanism. At the time of initiating an online transaction, an investor usually has to log into his/her bank account by entering a password. This is the first step of verification. As a next step for proceeding with the transaction, an investor must provide an OTP authentication for validating it.The new norms were to come into effect from Oct’21. However, AMFI or the Association of Mutual Funds in India requested the capital market regulator to extend this deadline to July 1, 2022. The regulator provided Mar’22 as the final deadline and also announced the suspension of any further NFOs until all the AMCs agree to comply with the norms.How does the NFO ban impact investors?With the bank on NFOs as a result of failure to comply with the new norms, SEBI has given a clear indication to all AMCs about the criticality of protecting investors’ interests. With the suspension of NFOs, investors are not expected to be highly impacted as there are several mutual funds already available in the market. In contrast, this is a good move for investors, as they can expect enhanced protection against any monetary losses in the future.In the interim, it is best for investors to check with the mutual fund intermediaries regarding any impact on their ability to transact in mutual funds through intermediaries.How are AMCs viewing the NFO ban?As per Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI), all mutual fund houses are in agreement with the SEBI decision on pausing NFOs since it will provide sufficient time for the AMCs to upgrade and align technological processes to SEBI norms.The mutual fund industry is positive about protecting investor interests and avoiding any chances of fraud, apart from containing operational risks.ConclusionEvery since the Karvy Stock Broking episode of illegal fund transfer and misuse of funds came to light, SEBI has been extra vigilant about identifying any possible loopholes in the mutual fund business operations. The latest move around NFOs is also aimed at maximising investor interest and curbing all possibilities of fraud in the investment process.FAQsCan I invest in an NFO now while SEBI has banned NFOs?Yes, you can still invest in NFOs that have already been rolled out before March 31. This is because SEBI ban on NFOs is effective from April 1 2022 and it does not restrict NFOs that were rolled out before this date.How to invest in NFOs?There are many ways to invest in NFOs. Investors can reach out to the AMC for investing in NFO or through a broker. Investors can also download the Finity app on their smartphone to invest in NFOs.What are NFOs?A New Fund Offer (NFO) of a mutual fund scheme is a way for asset management companies to launch new funds or schemes on a first-subscription basis. This helps fund houses in financing the purchase of securities while investors can gain early access to fund units.What is the benefit of investing in NFOs?The benefit of investing in NFOs is that some of them can be bought at a cheaper cost as compared to funds that are already present in the market. These are also heavily advertised and therefore catch the attention of investors easily.How can an investor ensure financial safety while investing in mutual funds?To ensure financial safety while investing in mutual funds, investors can opt for direct investment through a safe and known online platform instead of approaching a middleman who may pool funds into a central account before investing them in a scheme.Share the article                      Get exclusive content
