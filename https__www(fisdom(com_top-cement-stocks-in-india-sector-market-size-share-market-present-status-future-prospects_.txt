The cement production of the country accounts for more than 7% of the global installed capacity. As per market experts and industry analysis, cement consumption in the country is expected to reach 419.92 million tonnes by FY 2027. However, it is significant to note that the sector as a whole is expected to be increasing by 12% year on year despite the economic slowdown caused due to covid and other factors impacting the sector. The biggest demand in the cement sector is from the housing sector which accounts for approximately 60% of the demand in the country. The various government initiatives like Pradhan Mantri Jan Awas Yojana and many similar initiatives have aimed at providing affordable housing for all the citizens of the country. This has contributed to the demand for cement in the country as well as other development projects like roadways, railways, new airports, metros, commercial projects, etc. Also, the cement sector in the country is further segregated into various zones which helps the industry experts analyze the sector as well as its growth drivers, limitations, etc. These zones include the North, South, East, West, and Central zone. Among these zones, the south zone accounts for the maximum production capacity in the country of about 33% approximately. Government initiatives The cement sector being one of the pillars of the economy has seen many government initiatives that have helped not only in boosting the demand in the sector but also has stabilized the prices.

The export segment of the sector is also being given more impetus and the aim is to become the main exporter of clinker and gray cement to the Middle East, Africa, and other developing nations of the world.
