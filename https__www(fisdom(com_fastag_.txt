It was initially designed to be a pilot project in 2014 between Ahmedabad and Mumbai. After its initial success with individual projects, on 15th December 2019, FASTag was made mandatory on all National Highways. All the vehicles not having FASTag are charged double the toll amount across all the tolls in the country.FASTag is linked to a prepaid account with partner banks and the toll amount is deducted automatically when the vehicle passes the toll plaza. It uses Radio-frequency Identification (RFID) technology which is affixed to the windscreen of the vehicle after it is activated. Currently, there are more than 650 toll plazas across the country where FASTag is operational and provides cashless travel to the passengers. What are the benefits of FASTag?The implementation of FASTag has brought in many benefits for the passengers and the government alike. Some of the prime benefits of FASTag are detailed below.1.

This information includes the details of the amount deducted at the toll transactions, the low balance in the FASTag account, etc.3.
