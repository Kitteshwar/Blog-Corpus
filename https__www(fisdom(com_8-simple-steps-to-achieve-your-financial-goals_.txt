Take stock of current and future prioritiesWhile setting achievable financial goals, you must first know what is important to you. Your current age, stage of career,etc will affect your priorities and, in turn, your financial goals. For instance, if you have kids, you may want to focus on building a corpus for your child’s future. Other goals,and, such as buying a house or setting a retirement corpus, can be set by closely gauging the things that matter to you and noting them down before you proceed.3. Prioritise your goalsYou may have multiple financial goals to achieve in your life. However, not all of them can be achieved at once. While setting financial goals, you must segregate them between different time periods and priorities. There can be short-term, mid-term and long-term financial goals. By preparing a goal chart and listing all your goals, you can set specific timelines to achieve each of these goals.4. Work with a budgetA budget for your spending and savings can help you establish and achieve your financial goals. Start with a realistic budget to bring in financial discipline such that you can manage your spending while setting aside a corpus to meet your goals. You can easily make a budget by listing all your earnings and reducing your expenses from it. After considering all the necessary expenses, you can set a limit for maximum monthly expenditure.

Focus on clearing debtTo set achievable financial goals, you must clear your existing debt situation. If you owe money, you must try to clear it as quickly and diligently as possible. While paying loan EMIs, make sure that you do not delay or miss any repayments. If your liabilities are limited, it can help to foreclose loans. Parallely, you must know how much of your income is going towards debt repayments. This way you will know how much funds you have available for your financial goals. 7. Set aside funds for emergencyWhile initiating the process of setting achievable financial goals, you must check if you have sufficient amount kept aside for any financial emergencies. It makes sense to create an emergency fund that is easily accessible when needed. This can be apportioned from existing savings by keeping aside some amount every month or quarter towards emergency needs. You can also reserve a lump sum amount for emergencies in a bank account, since it can be maintained in cash form. Emergency funds should only be used when really needed, else it can backfire and skew your financial planning.8.
