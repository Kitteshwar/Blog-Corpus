Market capitalization measures a publicly-traded company’s worth by taking the share price of the company and multiplying this by the total number of shares outstanding. Every company has a different size and depending on its size, it could either be a large-cap, mid-cap, or small-cap company.Small-cap funds are equity mutual funds that invest primarily in small-cap companies. Small-cap companies are those which rank beyond 250 with regard to full market capitalisation. Small caps stocks are known to have high return potential but have many risks that come along. Small-cap companies have small-scale operations and also restricted access to resources. Thus, they often face survival risks when there is an economic downswing. Reasons to Invest in Small-cap fundsHere are some benefits offered by small-cap funds:Small-cap funds have a wider range of options for investment as compared to large cap, mid-cap or sector funds.Small cap companies have higher growth prospects because of new/emerging business segments that grow at a faster pace.Because of the availability of new technologies and products/services, these also have far greater potential to quickly gain market share.Small cap companies are influenced by company-specific factors more than by macroeconomic factors.As compared to large and mid-cap stocks, small-cap stocks can recover faster during economic recoveries.Top 5 Small-Cap Mutual Funds to Invest in 2023Based on historical performance, here are the top investment options within small-cap funds.Kotak Small Cap Axis Small Cap Fund HDFC Small Cap FundQuant Small Cap FundDSP Small Cap FundKotak Small Cap FundAbout FundThe principal objective of Kotak Small-cap fund is to generate capital appreciation through investment in various equity & equity-related securities of small-cap companies.

No fund can guarantee high returns and therefore, investors have to be prepared to face lower returns from small-cap funds too.Risk Small-cap funds can pose a significant amount of risk since they are heavily impacted by market volatility. There is always a high-risk-return tradeoff when it comes to small-cap funds. Therefore, only investors with a high-risk appetite and long-term goals must go for small cap funds. Growth potential of stocks Small cap funds are ideal to add growth to an investor’s portfolio. These can have tremendous growth potential as compared to large caps which are generally at the peak of the growth curve. Investors must pick funds which invest in stocks of fast-growing companies and have stronger potential to be future market leaders.Diversification benefitsMutual funds offer the benefit of diversification to investors, especially those investing in small-cap stocks. This way, investors can balance the risk-return tradeoff and enjoy the benefits of diversification. Investors must try and spread their investment across small cap, mid-cap, and large-cap stocks instead of purely focusing on small-cap funds which are generally high risk.End NoteSmall cap funds are ideal for investors with a higher risk appetite and long-term financial goals.
