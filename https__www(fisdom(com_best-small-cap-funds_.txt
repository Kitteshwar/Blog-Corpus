This way, investors can balance the risk-return tradeoff and enjoy the benefits of diversification. Investors must try and spread their investment across small cap, mid-cap, and large-cap stocks instead of purely focusing on small-cap funds which are generally high risk.End NoteSmall cap funds are ideal for investors with a higher risk appetite and long-term financial goals.
