Sit Back. Relax SiddharthaGuptaWritten by - Siddhartha GuptaMarch 4, 2021  4 minutes  Anybody who has ever entered the stock market has only had just one thing in mind – to beat the damn thing. Double the money, I say! Triple it! And do it before my next birthday. It’s ironic. The market’s gone up and up these past many decades, and yet, strangely, no money manager will ever say that getting the market’s returns is a worthy enough goal.So then, how do you beat a system that has millions of participants, each playing by his own rules, and all of them essentially blind to one another?An easy answer is, well, you don’t. A better answer is, you could try. How difficult could it possibly be? All you need to do is buy low, sell high. Time your entry and exit right. Right?But how do you do that? How will you know which stocks or funds will shine? How do you know the time is right? There are so many companies, so many variables to consider. There are company financials, business models, managers’ motivations, corporate structures, industry dynamics, and government regulations. There are also, of course, Reddit and Covid, and Elon Musk. So, how?Enter your friendly neighborhood uncle who moonlights as an investment advisor. He tells you that he has algorithms (you know, some ‘coding things,’ really hi-tech and all that). He tells you he has ‘clients’. He also tells you he has experience, and that he will add you to a Whatsapp group where he shares all his experience. That he will do all the hard and boring work so that you don’t have to. He asks you to trust him.You ask him what his services will cost. He says, oh not much, anywhere between 1-3% of your investment value. You think about it for a second. It doesn’t seem like a lot of money. The uncle looks like a value proposition.Except, you read somewhere that the percentage of uncles who have actually managed to beat the market consistently, out of all such uncles who have ever existed in the world, is actually in single digits. There is a greater than 90% chance that the market will do better than the uncle. Besides, his commission will eat into any gains he might be able to get you over and above the market. Who knows, over time, 1-3% might make all the difference in the world!You ask yourself if it’s worth it. Is it not better to just sit back, relax, and piggyback on the market, rise as it rises, let the gains build over time, like a bucket under a dripping tap that eventually, overflows?Drip. Drip. Drip.All that the market asks for is time. The market chooses the stocks for you. The market makes timing irrelevant. The market requires your patience. That may not be such an unreasonable request. After all, good things take time.You can be certain that the Market, on the whole, will rise over time, as it has in the past. Your money will grow. What is ‘Market,’ if not a reflection of the world we live in? As the world has advanced over time, become a better place, the growth has reflected in wealth creation across the globe. People are richer, happier, better off. They have more choices.Sometimes, the best thing to do is to do nothing. Put your money in low-cost index funds, for example, and forget about it for a while. Don’t grab the bull by the horns when you know you cannot control it. Don’t play tricks with it. Let the market do its thing. Who knows, it might even surprise you.Image designed by Freepik  Passive Investing  Best Gold ETFs to Invest in India 06 Jun  8 minutes   Passive Investing  Understanding Taxation Rules on Index Funds and ETFs 18 May  6 minutes   Passive Investing  SEBI Allows Launch of Passive ELSS Funds in India – Here’s All You Need to Know 03 Apr  6 minutes   Passive Investing  Passive Funds- What is It?, Types, and Best Funds in India 30 Mar  11 minutes   Passive Investing  How to Invest in Index funds in India? 29 Mar  7 minutes   Passive Investing  Index Funds Vs Mutual Funds – What is the Difference? 07 Mar  9 minutes   Passive Investing  What is Nifty Bees – Features & How to Invest in Nifty Bees? 03 Mar  5 minutes   Passive Investing  Top Nifty Index funds to Invest in 2023 10 Feb  6 minutes   Passive Investing  Gold Vs Silver ETF – Comparing returns 27 Jan  7 minutes   Passive Investing  Top  ETF in India-Available for Investment in 2023 08 Jan  7 minutes   Passive Investing  Index Funds Vs Individual Stocks – Which one is the better investment choice on 2023? 05 Jan  6 minutes   Passive Investing  Tracking Error in Index Funds: Causes & Impact 2023 31 Dec  6 minutes
