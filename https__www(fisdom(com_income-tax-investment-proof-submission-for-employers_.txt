The Income Tax Act has various provisions that provide deductions that can be used to reduce the overall tax liability. This declaration contains the details of all the investments made by the employee during the financial year. Based on the information given, the employers deduct the TDS that is to be deposited with the Government at the required due dates.Why is it important to provide investment proof?The process of providing investment proofs is mandatory for every employee and is the standard procedure for every organization. Given below are a few factors which show why it is important to provide investment proof.Investment proof is required so the employers can calculate the income tax and the TDS that is to be deducted from each month’s salary to be deposited with the government.Tax-saving investments can help in reducing the tax burden. However, any deductions or exemptions are available only when proper evidence is provided to support the claim.It is the responsibility of the employer to gather evidence of all the investments declared by the employees to ensure that there are no false claims of tax-saving investments. What are the important points to be considered while making tax-saving investments?We have discussed the importance of providing investment proof for validating the claim for tax-savings investments. Let us now discuss the various points that have to be considered while investing in tax-saving instruments and other assets.The first step is to compute the tax before investing in assets that qualify for deduction under Section 80C.The next step is to check the amount already contributed and any further amount that needs to be contributed in the financial year.There are many sections in the Income Tax Act that provide deductions and exemptions from the gross total income. Therefore, employees can use many options for tax-saving investments rather than focusing only on investments under section 80C.Employees can invest in provident fund under section 80C to the extent of Rs. 1,50,000 and beyond this limit investing in PF will not qualify for any deduction.Apart from Section 80C, employees can get an excess deduction of up to Rs. 50,000 for investment in NPS under section 80CCD(1).Finally, there are a wide variety of options available for investment under section 80C, therefore, while choosing an investment it is equally important to align such investment with the financial goals.   What other income proofs are to be submitted apart from salary income?Given below is the list of tax-saving investments and the proof to be submitted for each investment.Qualifying Investment Proof to be submittedPublic Provident FundCopy of the stamped deposit receipt paid during the current financial year, or,Copy of passbook clearly mentioning the PPF account.  ELSS mutual fundCopy of investment certificate with details like employee name, date of investment, investment amount, type of investment, etc.Life insurance policyPremiums paid towards life insurance for self, spouse and/or childrenTax-saving FDsCopy of the deposit receipt HRAMonthly rent receiptsPan Card of the landlord (if rent amount is higher than Rs. 1,00,000)Revenue stamps to be fixed on cash paymentsHousing LoanInterest certificate from the bank/financial institution with the total interest and principal paid/due for the FY. Completion certificate of the house property from the builder, or, Self-declaration from the employee with the details of occupationNSC Copy of NSC Certificate in the name of the employeeTuition Fees of childrenCopy of tuition fees paid to educational institutions along with the nature of payment (donation fees, capitation fees, sports fees, transport fees, uniform and stationery fees, etc. Post Office Term DepositCopy of deposit receipt (qualifying deposits are deposits over 5 years)Preventive Health check-ups under section 80DCopy of premium receipt paid during the year.

However, they can claim a refund of the same at the time of filing their ITR and providing necessary proofs at that time.Is interest paid on home loan and principal amount eligible for deduction?Yes interest on home loan and principal amount is eligible for deduction under section 80C and section 24 respectively provided a bank certificate for the same is submitted as investment proof.Related ArticlesTop Tax-Saving FundsForm 12BB – Investment Declaration GuideTax saving FDs and their benefitsFactors influencing the approval of an unsecured loanDeductions Under Section 80CShare the article                      Get exclusive content
