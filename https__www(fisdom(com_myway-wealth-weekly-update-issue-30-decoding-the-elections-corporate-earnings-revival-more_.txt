Elections come & go, each time elections happen there are two events that manifest every single time – we always get a government and two, life goes on!Equity, at a very basic level, is nothing but a part of a business and businesses do not come and go with elections. Businesses are here to stay, grow and create wealth.And if you look at Q4 earnings this week, you’ll notice that we are perhaps at the cusp of an earnings revival and equity outperformance that comes along.Company NameQ4 Earning Result DateCommentaryResults vs. Analyst ExpectationHDFC Bank24-Apr-19Reported a record quarterly net profit of 58.85 billion rupees ($848 million) Reason: High fee & interest incomeBeats EstimatesUltratech Cement24-Apr-19Reported a quarterly net profit of INR.1,017 crore  Reason: Acquisition of Binani CementsBeats EstimatesMaruti Suzuki25-Apr-19Reported a quarterly net profit of INR.1,795 crore  Reason: High foreign exchange rates and commodity pricesBeats EstimatesAxis Bank25-Apr-19Reported a quarterly net profit of INR.1,505 crore  Reason: Provisions & Contingencies dropped by 62% Y-o-YDid not beat estimatesTata Steel25-Apr-19Reported a quarterly net profit of INR.2,295 croreBeats EstimatesYes Bank26-Apr-19Reported its first-ever quarterly loss at ₹1,506 crore  Reason: Total provisions during the quarter increased more than nine-fold. Bank has outstanding loan to Il& FS groupDid not beat estimatesFor those wondering if it is the right time to invest given that elections are in progress and markets are volatile, here are my two cents:Ask yourself another question – when would it be the right time to invest? After the dust settles? When will the dust settle? And, will it ever settle?Equity markets are structured to be volatile and volatility is where real profit is made.Governments come and go, but equities continue to grow. Why sit on the fence when the field is so opportunistic?Explore MoreIf you have any concern, please write to us at ask@fisdom.com or call at 080 48039999, we would be happy to answer your query.Thanks, Nirav (Head of Research) Fisdom  The SignalWeekly Dose  The Signal (weekly highlights) 02 Sep  3 minutes   The SignalWeekly Dose  The Signal (weekly highlights) 26 Aug  3 minutes   The SignalWeekly Dose  The Signal (weekly highlights) 19 Aug  4 minutes   The SignalWeekly Dose  The Signal (weekly highlights) 12 Aug  3 minutes   The SignalWeekly Dose  The Signal (weekly highlights) 05 Aug  3 minutes   The SignalWeekly Dose  The Signal (weekly highlights) 29 Jul  3 minutes   Weekly Dose  The Signal (weekly highlights) 27 May  3 minutes   Weekly Dose  The Signal (weekly highlights) 13 May  3 minutes   Weekly Dose  The Signal (weekly highlights) 22 Apr  3 minutes   Weekly Dose  The Signal (weekly highlights) 15 Apr  2 minutes   Weekly Dose  The Signal (weekly highlights) 08 Apr  3 minutes   Weekly Dose  The Signal (weekly highlights) 01 Apr  3 minutes
