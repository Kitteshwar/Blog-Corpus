There is also a broader rhythm to these crashes, and closely studying the same can give us insight into the nuances. There are many important learnings to be derived from stock market crashes. Here, we present top five lessons that investors can learn and be better prepared for a smoother investment journey. Top 5 learnings from stock market crashesHere are the top 5 learnings from historical stock market crashes:1. Patience paysDuring a market crash, it is normal for investors to become impatient and sell their holdings to either rebalance their portfolios or sell entirely. However, steady investors who have gained wealth in the long run tend to not only survive crashes but also end up gaining substantially during market highs. While there is no certainty about a market downturn and its timing, historical data suggests that the markets always recover regardless of how bad the crash would have been. Therefore, investors must continue to explore attractive investment opportunities and remain invested as per their plan.2. Focus on individual portfolioCertain common psychological behavior patterns are observed across various global market crashes. Some of these include herd mentality and overconfidence in decisions. These are best avoided and investors should instead focus on their portfolios while making decisions. 3. Avoid liquidating out of panicBear markets may last longer than one can imagine. In such scenarios, it is easy to be tempted to liquidate one’s portfolio. Very few investors sit tight with their investments and wait for the frenzy to be over. In such situations, investors should reassess their portfolio and try to rebalance the assets as per any alterations to the risk-reward profile. 4. Never speculateThose who speculate in stock markets are often the ones who are hardest hit during market crashes. Speculation is best avoided by stock market investors who aim for wealth creation in the long run. While it can help in achieving short-term and one-off benefits, it can easily increase one’s overall portfolio risk.5. Work with fundamentalsInvestors should focus on investing in companies that have strong fundamentals. Companies that have the right risk-mitigating strategies in place tend to invariably come out of disruptive market events. Company fundamentals can win over other external factors in influencing the intrinsic value of the company’s stock in the long run. Focusing on this can lead to higher returns for investors, irrespective of market crashes.History of Indian stock market crashesUPA election 2004 – In May 2004, the stock market fell 15.52% which is considered one of the largest crashes in the history of Indian markets.2006 crash – In May 2006, the Sensex fell by 826 points to 11,391 as a result of the global market crash. Financial crisis of 2007–2008 – the Indian stock markets fell on multiple occasions in 2007 and 2008 due to the sub-prime crisis in the US.Crash of 2009 – In July 2009, the Sensex fell by 869 points to 14,043 as a result of the US housing market collapse.Crash of 2015 – In January 2015, the Sensex fell by 854 points to 26,987 as a result of worldwide sell-offs.Crash of 2016 – Resulting from NPAs of Indian banks combined with global weakness.
