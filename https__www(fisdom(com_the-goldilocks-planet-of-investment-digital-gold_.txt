You can skip and straight away go to the section ‘Why is 24K Digital Gold A Better World for Gold Investment?’ Before we fly into the idea of Digital Gold being the better alternative world for gold investment, it would be wise to understand why are we referring to Digital Gold being a Goldilock planet and the source of this term.Understanding the Concept of ‘Goldlilocks Planet’It all starts with a fairy-tale: ‘Goldilocks and The Three Bears’. This is the story of a little girl with golden locks of hair who confidently walks into a home of a family of bears who aren’t at home and checks out her compatibility with their different sized chairs and beds. Of course, she eats all their porridge and does get caught in the end but indeed is the idea behind naming these special planets Goldilocks planet. A Goldilocks planet is all about the idea of finding a world that is possibly habitable by carbon-life forms, based on similar features and conditions that exist on Earth. This is extremely difficult to find despite the fact that the universe is limitless and scientists have found only a few possible Goldilocks planet with Earth-like living conditions. You could watch or recollect your memories of watching Christopher Nolan’s science-fiction opera, ‘Interstellar’. It has the concept of Goldilocks planets well explored.How is Gold investment a Goldilocks Planet?The immediate idea to buy and sell or trade gold would require a jewellery store or a bank. What if these options aren’t available due to circumstances that could vary from the store is too far to you are sitting at home due to a lockdown? You will need to find a Goldlick alternative for Gold. Digital Gold is not just the answer but it could be possibly a better alternative to regular Gold in multiple ways. However on the contrary in the literal sense of Goldilocks planets, there is no place like home when it comes to Earth and no matter how many Goldilocks planets there are in the universe, bursting with life, Earth is the only home planet we have.Why is 24K Digital Gold A Better World for Gold Investment?If regular Gold is Earth, then Digital Gold is a planet like Asgard with narcissistic God-like humanoids roaming around with hammers and staffs with special powers. Not really, that’s not true but in case you want to be an ‘InvesThor’ of Gold, Digital Gold is the right option for the following benefits:Pay only for 24K Gold: When you buy the jewellery store you are not paying for the gold you are also paying on metals and studded stones and gems. But that is different in the case of buying digital gold. Every rupee you invest is paid to pure 24K gold which has 99.9% of purity ridding it of making charges and precious stones that don’t have any resale value.The convenience of trading: We are all aware that buying gold can be time-consuming as you need to visit the jeweller, store or bank. With the digital gold investment, you can buy and sell gold online anytime and anywhere as per your comfort. You can even track your gold investment if you are buying gold on our app.Gold can be converted to cash in seconds: You can easily sell digital gold online anytime and anywhere. As soon as you sell the 24k gold the amount is successfully transferred to your bank account. Where in to liquidate the physical gold you need to visit the seller during the working hours and then you sell the gold.Zero storage hassles: We all know physical gold needs to be stored in bank locker and vaults, which come with long term expensive storage costs where digital gold saves from such hassles as it stores your accumulated gold in safe and secure vaults.Digital Gold investment doesn’t have to be a big amount: The best part about buying Gold online is that you do not have to buy large amount of Gold unlike at the stores and keep accumulating it over time by buying small amounts at a time. For example, on our app, you can buy gold for as low as ₹1000 at a time, regardless of what the price of Gold is at the time.While you can be an ‘InvesThor’ of Gold on our app, do not forget that the most simple life forms are the most powerful and that a Goldilocks planet of gold investment requires simplicity like the scientifically almost immortal amoeba, to thrive.‘We’re made of star stuff’ – Carl Sagan[tek_button button_text=”Download Fisdom App” button_link=”url:https%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F3h8zh14||target:%20_blank|” button_position=”button-center”]Join our Fin Insight CommunityShare the article                      Get exclusive content
