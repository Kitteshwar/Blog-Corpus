Some of such common factors are mentioned below. a. Understanding the basics of the stock marketThe first step while investing in stocks is a thorough understanding of the markets. Cherry picking stocks allows the investor to pick the most profitable and consistently performing stocks. Such a basis for cherry picking can be by referring to successful mutual fund managers too.

Such selection will ensure that the risk-return profile of the investors is maintained. Also, the investors will not be bombarded with multiple stocks in the system that can potentially generate good returns. c. Keep track of the latest developments in the marketAfter selecting the target sector or a particular class of stocks for investment (like blue-chip stocks, mid-cap stocks, etc.) it is also important to keep track of all the latest developments and changes in the market related to such stocks. This will help the investors navigate the market volatility better and avoid any chances of major losses. d. Understand the company profile Understanding the company profile is another important aspect that cannot be ignored while cherry picking the stocks. The various factors relating to the company profile that has to be monitored by the investors are mentioned below. 1. Products and stage of the product in the marketThe products of the company have to be able to adapt to the changing needs of the industry and need to be preferably market dominant.

Sales and profit projectionThe sale and profit projections of the company have to be quite strong and have to be on an increasing trend on a year on year basis.

ManagementThe management of the company has to be quite competent to drive the business to profitability.
