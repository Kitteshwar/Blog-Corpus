Here, we will explore some commonly available money market funds:Certificate of depositCD or Certificate of deposit is like fixed deposits offered by banks. These are also called term deposits and are mostly offered by scheduled commercial banks. In case of an FD, premature withdrawals are permitted, but in a CD the funds are locked in for the agreed period.Treasury billsWe commonly know Treasury bills as T-bills under money market fund schemes. These are issued by the Government of India to raise capital for up to 365 days. Since these are backed by the government, they are considered as one of the safest money market instruments. However, it is worth noting that the risk-free rate on T-bills is also the lowest among all the other money market instruments.Commercial PaperAnother instrument for money market fund investment is commercial paper or CP. The financial institutions or companies which have a high credit rating are permitted to issue CP to their investors. A CP is also called a promissory note.Although CPs are issued at a discounted rate and redeemed at face value, they are considered to be unsecured instruments.Repurchase agreementsA repurchase agreement is between a bank and RBI for facilitating short-term loans. It can also take place between two banks. These agreements cover both the sale and purchase of agreement at the same time.Why invest in money market funds?Here are some top reasons money market funds have gained popularity among investors.Low/Moderately Low RiskMoney market funds come with a low or moderately low risk level. This is because they invest in securities with maturities of up to one year. Since they primarily invest in money market securities, these funds offer low credit risk. Thus, money market funds generally offer stable returns combined with low volatility.LiquidityMoney market mutual funds offer the flexibility to withdraw money easily at any point. This gives investors easy access to cash whenever required. Money market funds invest mainly in highly liquid instruments. ReturnsCompared to other cash equivalents, money market funds offer higher returns. However, the returns also depend on the Net Asset Value (NAV) which keeps changing due to rise or fall in the interest rates of the unit. When the interest rate drops, the price of the money market fund unit rises and investors can get good returns. Who Should Invest in Money Market Funds?Money market funds may be an ideal fit for some investors. On the other hand, these may not be the right options to include in an investment portfolio for some investors. Here are the type of investors who can benefit from investing in money market funds:Investors with short-term surpluses: Most money market funds offer steady returns and are therefore ideal for investors who have surplus funds which can be parked for short-term periods. The invested funds will most-likely generate steady earnings in the short run.Investors looking for steady short-term income: Money market funds come with the benefits of stability and liquidity. Investors who have a low-risk appetite can invest a portion of their wealth in these funds to earn steady short-term income.Investors looking to explore alternate short-term saving options: Money market funds can earn more than fixed deposits or savings accounts. This is because their income comes from interest payments combined with capital gains. Hence, investors who are looking to gain slightly higher returns than basic bank deposits can invest in money market mutual funds.Recommended Money Market FundsBased on historical performance, here are the top investment options within this fund category:UTI Money Market FundICICI Prudential Money Market FundAditya BSL Money Manager FundKotak Money Market SchemeUTI Money Market FundAbout FundThe scheme aims to earn reasonable income for investors by maintaining high liquidity levels in the investment portfolio comprising of money market instruments.

Some risk factors are interest rate risk and credit risk. Also, for generating better returns, the fund manager may invest in instruments that have a slightly higher risk factor. Thus, money market mutual funds are not entirely risk-free.Expense RatioSince the returns offered by money market funds are not very high, the expense ratio helps in determining an investor’s earnings from the fund investment. Expense Ratio is calculated as a percentage of the total assets held by the fund. This is charged by the fund house for offering fund management services. Ideally, an investor looking to maximise returns should invest in funds which have a lower expense ratio.Investment Time HorizonMoney market funds are ideal for investors with an investment horizon of 90-365 days. Investors who want to stay invested in the long run should explore equity funds.TaxationInvestors who hold the units of the fund for a period of maximum three years may earn capital gains, which are called short-term capital gains or STCG. This is added to the individual’s total taxable income and is taxed as per the prevailing income tax slab. If an investor holds the units of the scheme beyond three years, then the capital gains are called long-term capital gains or LTCG. LTCG is taxable at 20% along with indexation benefits.End NoteInvesting in money market mutual funds is easy and can be done offline or online.
