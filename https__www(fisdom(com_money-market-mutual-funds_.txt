Some risk factors are interest rate risk and credit risk. Also, for generating better returns, the fund manager may invest in instruments that have a slightly higher risk factor. Thus, money market mutual funds are not entirely risk-free.Expense RatioSince the returns offered by money market funds are not very high, the expense ratio helps in determining an investor’s earnings from the fund investment. Expense Ratio is calculated as a percentage of the total assets held by the fund. This is charged by the fund house for offering fund management services. Ideally, an investor looking to maximise returns should invest in funds which have a lower expense ratio.Investment Time HorizonMoney market funds are ideal for investors with an investment horizon of 90-365 days. Investors who want to stay invested in the long run should explore equity funds.TaxationInvestors who hold the units of the fund for a period of maximum three years may earn capital gains, which are called short-term capital gains or STCG. This is added to the individual’s total taxable income and is taxed as per the prevailing income tax slab. If an investor holds the units of the scheme beyond three years, then the capital gains are called long-term capital gains or LTCG. LTCG is taxable at 20% along with indexation benefits.End NoteInvesting in money market mutual funds is easy and can be done offline or online.
