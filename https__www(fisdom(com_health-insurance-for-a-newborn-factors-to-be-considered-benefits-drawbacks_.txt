Some of the key factors while considering newborn health insurance are,Scope of Coverage The scope of coverage is one of the prime factors to be considered while taking newborn health insurance. There are some insurers who provide coverage for vaccinations and specified illnesses. Therefore, it is ideal for parents to first check the scope of coverage and the expenses that will be covered under the insurance plan.Policy exclusions Every health insurance policy has a specific set of exclusions that are outside the purview of the claim. Therefore, before opting for a plan, it is important to understand and be fully aware of such exclusions to avoid any last-minute hassles at the time of claim settlements. Waiting period of the plan Most health insurance plans for newborns come into effect after the infant is 90 days old. This means that even if the health insurance plan is taken before the birth or right after the birth of the child, it will have a waiting period of up to 90 days from the day the child is born.
