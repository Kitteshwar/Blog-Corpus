Further, govt.’s flagship ‘Atmanirbhar’ policy and broadening PLI scheme will be instrumental in printing GDP growth for the near and short-term, with long-lasting effects on long-term growth.2. Manufacturing Makes Promising PotentialIndia Manufacturing PMI recorded 57.5 in February vs 57.7 in January. In October, it recorded the highest figures in 12 years at 58.9. Remaining flat-to-positive, the index remained above its long-run average of 53.6. The PMI reading has maintained growth trajectory for 7 th month in a row. As is seen globally, manufacturing PMI continues to out-perform its services counterpart, courtesy of the latter being hit harder by Covid-19. 3-month joint-highest business optimism can translate into healthier economic conditions in times to come. Vaccination drives to play instrumental role in the same.3. Services Serves Growth On The MenuIndia Services PMI increased to 55.3 in February from 52.8 in January, growing at its fastest pace in over a year. Growing for 5 months in a row, survey credited the uptick to improved demand and more favorable market conditions.

In expedition of New Normal, the country is quick to adapting and improvising on current challenges to make them future opportunities for growth.5. Subsidy Suite Puts A Spring On SafetySubsidy bill is likely to be higher for 2021-22 compared to budget estimate (BE) 2020-21, but possibly lower than RE 2020-21. Higher spending on food and fertilizer sees minimal comfort by reduced in low oil prices. Cash transfers also saw robust response from beneficiaries, as can be inferred from data on Aadhaar-enabled Payment System, where the value and volume of transactions have risen steadily this year.The higher outlay on subsidy must also be seen in the backdrop of the Covid-19 pandemic and lockdown, with the Centre announcing relief measures under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana.
