How do UPI payments work?What is ONDC?ONDC stands for Open Network for Digital Commerce which is a non-profit making organization incorporated under section 8 in India. It is the initiative from the Department of Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade under the Ministry of Commerce and Industry.  It aims to provide a level playing field to all the participants in the e-commerce business. It will serve as a common platform for standardizing the supply value chain, operations, and logistics, including suppliers from every corner of the country. This will give a huge boost to the country’s e-commerce sector and will help integrate consumers and suppliers across the country by creating an open network for them. How will ONDC work?The need for a common platform was seen when the small-scale D2C businesses were majorly left out of the e-commerce space although this sector is set to grow at a pace of 20% annually. 80% of the retail space in the country is filled with small kirana stores and small shops that are not able to participate in the e-commerce boom on account of a lack of expertise, scale, or finances. ONDC will function on the basis of an open network where it will not be a single platform similar to Amazon or Flipkart but rather in the form of a gateway where buyers and sellers across different platforms will be able to connect. The crux of this interface will be seen in the form of a ONDC buyer app and a ONDC  seller-side app with a gateway between the two that will connect them. The gateway will act as a common thread that will enable price discovery as well as matching the buyers and sellers on the basis of parameters like availability, accessibility, location, customer choices, etc. Working of ONDC  -Image Source: Smartprix.comThe buyer-side application will be responsible for buyers from various zones who can login to the app and search for the goods and services that they need.
