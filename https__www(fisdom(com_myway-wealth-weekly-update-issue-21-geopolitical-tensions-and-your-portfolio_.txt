But, a closer look at how the Indian markets reacted in similar situations should lend a better perspective to today.As evident by the above graph, markets have reacted negatively but for a brief period. Looking at these periods from a different perspective, one would realise that investors who held tight or perhaps purchased more during the slump emerged as the biggest winners in only a year.But, what about the coinciding elections? Does it add fuel to the fire?‘Elections’ are often misquoted as a major investor concern. However, the real fear is always about a change in the policy along with the government.
