New parents often get overwhelmed with the responsibility of financial planning for not only the newborn but also for themselves.

Here are a few pointers that can be followed by new parents to manage their finances effectively and simply enjoy their time with their newborn without any financial hassles.   Table of Contents  hide   1 Tips to manage finance for new parents   2 Additional points to consider   3 Conclusion   4 FAQs Tips to manage finance for new parentsManaging the finances when you have a newborn can be difficult even for people who are disciplined with their finances. The unexpected trips to the doctor or the additional expenses on account of planning for the child’s education, financial security, etc. are just a few additional things to look out for while managing the finances. Given below are a few things to consider by new parents to manage their finances.Planning a monthly budgetThe first and foremost thing for any financial planning is setting a budget. Here too, one of the first things to be considered by new parents is the monthly budget. It is essential to not underestimate the expenses and have a sufficient budget to meet all the needs of the newborn as well as other important non-negotiable expenses.Setting up an emergency fundWhen you have a child at home you never know when a simple day can turn into an emergency situation and you may need to rush to the doctor. It is therefore essential that there is a sufficient emergency fund at one’s disposal at all times. An emergency fund will help in giving the new parents a much needed breather without having any financial stress. Keep the expenses in check and avoid non-essential expensesNew parents try to give the best of everything for their child and this often leads to splurging in baby stores on toys, clothes, additional baby material like cribs, cots, etc. It is essential to remember here that babies do not need much to be happy and healthy. Hence, it is better to avoid unnecessary expenses and extravagance.Increase investments for new goalsInsurers today have many children’s plans that can take care of the education and higher education needs of the child along with their financial expenses in the long run. The majority of experts suggest investing in the child’s education plans right from the time they are born. This helps parents gradually build a huge corpus for their child’s education and secure their future. Parents have multiple options to choose from for children’s plans. They can select the plan that is most suited to their needs in terms of premium payments or amount to be invested in, tenure, investment objectives, etc. Plan for retirement While planning a better future for the child is every parent’s responsibility, it is important that they do not forget to plan for their retirement too. Starting to plan for retirement at a later stage of life is a bad move. In such cases, individuals will have limited time to have sufficient funds to secure their retirement and not be dependent on anyone, even their children. Hence, it is important to remember that planning for retirement and making sound investments should also be given due importance along with securing the newborn’s future Additional points to considerApart from the above essential tips to manage the finances, there are a couple of additional points that should not be ignored by new parents. Given below are the details of the same.Having a health insurance cover for the childNot many new parents are aware that they can get health insurance cover for their newborns. A standard health insurance plan includes coverage for spouses and children. The waiting period for such health insurance policies to include cover for newborns is different depending on their guidelines. However, most insurers provide coverage for newborns after about 90 days of their birth. An effective health insurance cover will further relieve the parents in times of a medical emergency and help them focus solely on caring for the child.Increase in the term or life insurance coverageTerm insurance or life insurance is an essential investment for every individual, especially if they are the sole earning member of the family. Having a newborn will increase the responsibilities of the parent and the financial needs of the family. Hence, it is better to increase the cover of the term insurance or the life insurance already in place to meet the additional needs of the family.ConclusionThere is no definite formula for optimum financial planning and management.
