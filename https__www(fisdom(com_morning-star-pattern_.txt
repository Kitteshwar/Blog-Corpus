This pattern is a bullish reversal trend where the downward or the bearish trend is viewed to be reversed. This pattern is also known as the Three Inside Down Pattern where the bulls are seen to be taking control from a bearish trend. This creates a buying pressure on the stock and the prices are seen on the upward side. This pattern is named after the star on the candlestick that appears when the stock prices close above the opening price in an upward trend. How to identify the morning star pattern?There are many interpretations of the candlesticks and it sometimes becomes difficult for the traders to identify their target pattern amid the chaos of the markets. Therefore, to identify the morning star pattern, traders can watch out for the following events. The first step is to observe the market to establish a trend.The target stock has to be primarily on a downward trend and the first candle has to be red indicating a bearish mood.The second candle has to be a smaller body with a long wick on both ends. The colour of the candle is immaterial at this point.The third candle should be green and has to be backed by larger volumes. It should be of the same size as the first candle if not larger. When the third candle is backed by larger volumes indicating a bullish mood, a successful morning star pattern is said to have formed. When the stock is on a downward trend, the prices of the stock keep going down. The buyer or the bulls enter the market when the stock prices are sufficiently low. This begins the buying trend and the sellers also start covering their short positions. This further intensifies the upward trend as the prices of the stock keep increasing finally creating a bullish market. What is the significance of the morning star pattern?The morning star pattern is a visual pattern that needs no complex calculation to execute successfully. It is a trend reversal pattern that indicates when an upward trend is formed. This pattern is formed in three trading sessions or is not formed at all.
