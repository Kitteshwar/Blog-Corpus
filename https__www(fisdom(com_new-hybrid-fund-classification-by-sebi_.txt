There is a fund called “Hybrid Funds” that provides this mixture. By investing in hybrid funds an investor gains a diversified portfolio meaning, with the help of one fund, the investor gets access to multiple asset classes. Let’s look at the various hybrid funds classified by SEBI.Conservative Hybrid FundAs the name suggests, these funds are for conservative investors who are willing to take low or moderate risk. These funds primarily invest in debts i.e. 75 – 90% of your investment corpus goes for debt securities. They also invest 10 – 25% in equity and equity related instruments. The top-performing conservative hybrid funds include:Aditya Birla Sun Life Savings Fund GrowthUTI Savings Fund GrowthICICI Prudential Savings Fund GrowthBalanced Hybrid FundMost mutual fund investors advice newbies to begin with balanced hybrid funds. The advantage of investing in these funds is that they carry lower risk than the pure equity funds. They invest 40-60% of their total assets in a mixture of debt or equity & equity related instruments. One should be aware that these schemes do not invest in arbitrage. The top-performing balanced funds include:(Funds Unrated)Aggressive Hybrid FundThese funds understand the investment objective and decide the proportions of debt and equity exposure. Unlike balanced hybrid funds, these funds take the advantage of arbitrage (buy low priced assets from one stock exchange and sell them in another stock exchange for a higher price). These funds allocate 65-80% of the investment corpus towards equity and 20-35% in debt. The top performing aggressive hybrid funds include:ICICI Prudential Equity & Debt Fund GrowthSBI Equity Hybrid Fund GrowthHDFC Hybrid Eq GrowthReliance Equity Hybrid Fund – GrowthAditya Birla Sun Life Equity Hybrid ’95 Fund GrowthL&T Hybrid Equity Fund GrowthDynamic Asset Allocation or Balanced AdvantageIn these funds, fund managers invest in securities based on various metrics such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-book(P/B) or dividend yields.
