Gold ETFs are the securities that track the prices of physical gold which is of 99.5% purity. Each unit of gold ETF represents one gram of gold. It is a better investment option than traditional gold as the units can be held in the dematerialized format in the Demat account and can be traded like shares. Traditional gold has to be stored in safety which has its own set of costs and security issues. Therefore, investing in gold ETFs proves to be a better option and a better instrument to hedge against stock market volatility or inflation.  What is Silver ETF?Silver ETFs are similar to gold ETFs and invest in physical silver or silver-related instruments. They track the prices of physical silver in the open market. Investment is made in physical silver of purity 99.99%. Silver has traditionally been a very highly sought-after metal on account of its industrial as well as personal use. Investment in silver ETFs can be done in a similar manner to any other ETF by having a Demat account. Silver ETFs are an excellent instrument to hedge against inflation and are taxed in lines of any debt fund or capital asset where the if an asset is held for a period of more than 3 years, the long-term capital gains will be taxed at 20%. What are the differences between Gold and Silver ETFs?Gold and silver ETFs, both are an excellent addition to any investment portfolio. However, when deciding between the two, investors first need to understand their key differences. These differences are highlighted below. CategoryGold ETFSilver ETFCost of investment The cost of investing in gold ETFs is slightly higher as the prices of gold have traditionally been higher than that of silver. Silver ETFs are more reasonably priced as compared to gold ETFs and can be a good addition to the investment portfolio. Volatility Gold has limited uses as compared to silver. Therefore, the prices of this metal are not affected greatly due to economic fluctuations. Hence, investment in gold ETFs is less volatile.  Silver traditionally has wide industrial uses which have been amped with the increased push to the solar energy and the EV sector. Therefore, the demand for this metal is highly volatile as compared to gold which ultimately impacts its prices.LiquidityThe demand for gold ETFs is higher as compared to silver ETFs which makes them more liquid.Silver ETFs are known to face higher liquidity issues as compared to gold ETFs.Expense ratioThe expense ratio of gold ETFs is traditionally lower as compared to silver ETFs. The storage costs of silver are higher as compared to gold which impacts the ultimate expense ratio of the ETF. Therefore, the expense ratio of silver ETFs is slightly higher as compared to gold ETFs. ReturnsAlthough the demand for silver is varied and wide as compared to gold, the returns generated by gold ETFs are higher. The returns from silver ETFs are impacted on account of the volatility of demand for this metal as well as the higher expense ratio. Therefore, returns from silver ETFs are lower as compared to that from gold ETFs. Performance of Gold vs Silver ETFsTo understand the performance of gold and silver ETFs, let us look at the performance of the top ETFs in each category.Performance of Gold ETFsSome of the top gold ETFs and their performance are highlighted in the data below. 1.
