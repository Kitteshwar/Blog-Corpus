Most major banks, such as Axis Bank, ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank, SBI, etc, offer payment gateways. Benefits of using payment gateway:Users can use any debit card or internet banking for transfer of funds into a trading account. The fund transfer is done immediately. The trading account reflects the credit amount and allows users to start trading immediately. Factors to keep in mind:Every time a user uses the payment gateway, the broker debits a fee that can range between Rs. 10 and Rs. 20. Those who frequently need to add funds to their trading account may find this option expensive. As per SEBI regulations, the transfer of funds into a trading account via credit or charge card is not allowed. Therefore, one can only make use of debit cards or net banking in this option. Fund transfer into trading account – via NEFT / RTGS / IMPSAnother and more popular alternative for transferring funds to a trading account is by using National Electronic Fund Transfer (NEFT). Normally, this process takes anywhere between 2-3 hours for some of the top banks, like HDFC and SBI. However, if the NEFT is carried out from the same bank where the investor’s broker has an account, then the transfer is done instantaneously. Using NEFT for transfer to trading accountTo use NEFT:A user must add the broker’s bank account as a beneficiaryUsers can then transfer funds via password and OTP for additional authentication. No fund transfer charges are applicable. It can be done online or via an NEFT cheque at the bank branch since both use the same amount of time. Using RTGS for transfer to trading accountReal-time gross settlement (RTGS) is similar to NEFT. The primary difference between the two is that RTGS is used for fund transfers that are above Rs. 2 lakhs. Using IMPS for transfer to trading account NEFT and RTGS can be used for fund transfer to trading accounts only during normal banking hours, which is generally between 9.00 am to 6.00 pm. Any NEFT transactions done after these timings will be effected only on the next banking day. This is when IMPS comes into the picture. IMPS fund transfer is instantaneous and outside of the banking hours or holidays. IMPS differs from NEFT services due to the amount of time taken for transfer and the availability of service. It is important to note that IMPS has fund transfer charges which can end up adding to one’s overall trading cost.Fund transfer using UPIThe prevalence of UPI has meant that funds can be easily transferred to your trading account using any of the UPI apps like Google Pay, PayTm, Axis Mobile, Amazon, etc . The amount will be instantly debited from your linked bank account and credited into your trading account. Fund transfer into trading account – via cheque / DDInvestors and traders can transfer funds into their trading accounts by issuing a cheque in favor of the broker. This option can only be used in case one has an offline trading account. For online trading accounts, it is easier to transfer funds through a payment gateway or using NEFT/RTGS. Factors to keep in mind:While transferring funds via cheque/ DD to a trading account:The broker gives credit for the cheque / DD amount once the clearing credit is received after 2-3 days. Users must ensure that the cheque is signed appropriately and their account is well funded. Cheque rejections attract penal charges and the amount gets debited by the broker from the trading account.ConclusionMany different modes can be used for transfer of funds into a trading account. Each of the above-mentioned modes comes with certain advantages and disadvantages. Therefore, an investor or trading must make the right choice as per personal convenience while investing or trading. It is important to make sure that all the transfer details are recorded and checked frequently so that one can have full control of personal funds that go into the trading account.FAQsWhat is a Demat account?A Demat or Dematerialised account offers investors and traders the facility of retaining stocks and securities in electronic format.
