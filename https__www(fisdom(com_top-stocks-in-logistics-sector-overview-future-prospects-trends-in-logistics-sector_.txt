Apart from this, the logistics sector is also seeing various technological progression and digital transformations. This is helping the sector gain better agility and integration in transportation. There is also a better connect seen between users and third-party service providers. As customers of this industry are in need of more customised and cost-effective solutions, there is an emergence of third-party and fourth-party logistics service providers to deal with complex supply chain bottlenecks.Growth drivers in Indian logistics sectorSome of the factors driving growth in this sector are:Supportive government regulationsContinued sectoral expansion, aided by various reforms announced by the government, the logistics sector is slated to be one of the key growth drivers for the Indian economy.
