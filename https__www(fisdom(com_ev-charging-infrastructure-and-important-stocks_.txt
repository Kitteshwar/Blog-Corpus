One of the most drastic impacts that are faced by the world, India included, is the severe rise in fuel rises. Given this rise and the growing carbon footprint in the world, electric vehicles or EVs are the need of the day. EVs have been part of the global and Indian markets for more than a decade. Today this sector has made significant progress and is only going to see an increase in the same hereon.   Table of Contents  hide   1 Power needs of EVs based on battery and power type   2 Charging infrastructure solutions   3 Alternative battery charging method   4 Pros and cons of battery swapping   5 Top EV charging Infrastructure stocks in India   6 Conclusion   7 FAQs   8 Related Articles In India, the government is giving a lot of push in the form of incentives and subsidies to promote the EV sector in the country and gradually phase out the ICE (Internal combustion Engines).

The government has come out with many measures and plans to set up EV charging infrastructure across the country to support and promote the EV sector. The basic requirements of the EVs based on the overall Indian EV sector as per the data collected by Niti Aayog and the Ministry of Power are highlighted below.VehicleBattery CapacityBattery VoltageE-2W (Two Wheelers)1.2-3.3 kWh48-72VE-3W (passengers/goods)3.6-8kWh48-60VE-cars (1st Generation)21 kWh72VE-cars (2nd Generation)30-80 kWh300-500VEV power needs based on power ratings and power typeType of chargingPower levelCurrent typeCompatible EV segments Normal Power Charging P<=7kWAC & DCE-2W, E-3W, E-cars, and other LCVs (up to 1 ton)Normal Power Charging 7kW<P<=22kWAC & DCE-2W, E-3W, E-cars, and other LCVs (up to 1 ton)High Power Charging 22kW<P<=50kWDCE-cars, LCVs, MCVs (1-6 ton)High Power Charging 50kW<P<200kWDCE-cars, LCVs, MCVs (1-6 ton)Charging infrastructure solutions There are three types of charging solutions available for the Indian customers. The details of these available options are mentioned below.Type of charging solutionPrivate charging Semi-public chargingPublic chargingUsageThis type of charging is suitable for a personalized charging station for personal EV or EF FleetThis type of charging is ideal for a shared charging station for notified EV usersThis is the shared charging station for the general publicLocationsSuch charging stations can be in independent homes, dedicated parking spaces in any apartment or offices, any notified location with land availabilityThis type of charging stations can be in apartment complexes, office campuses, gated communities, government buildings, universities, shopping malls, hospitals, etc.This type of charging can be in public parking lots, on-street parking, charging plazas, petrol pumps, highways, metro stationsOwnershipThe ownership of this type of charging is with individual EV owners, EV fleet owners, or operatorsThe ownership of this type of charging point is under host properties, Charge Point Operators (CPOs) OEMs (Original Equipment Manufacturers)The ownership of this charging type of municipal authorities, PSUs, CPOs, host propertiesOperationsThe charging point is self-operated or CPO-managedThe charging point is CPO-managedThe charging point is CPO-managedWatch this video on YouTubeAlternative battery charging methodThe above data shows that the overall charging infrastructure needs of the country are quite extensive. This scenario is when the EV sector is still at a very nascent stage in the country. As the sector grows the charging infrastructure needs will increase accordingly. On average, an EV battery will require anywhere between 60 minutes to 9 hours to be fully charged. In the case of rapid charges also the minimum time taken would be approximately 30 minutes. This will be highly cumbersome for the ultimate customers and also is a deterrent factor that keeps many potential customers away from the EV sector. Also, the cost of a battery in an EV is among the highest costs of the vehicle. Given the current scenario of the growing uncertainty, the cost of essential raw materials for battery manufacture like nickel, copper, cobalt, etc. has increased substantially. This has resulted in a steep rise in battery costs for EVs.The Government of India viewing these factors has announced a new policy for the EV sector. This new policy is based on the concept of battery swapping and will have interoperable standards. The complete details of this program will be finalized soon and provided to the general public. The concept of battery swapping will allow the customers to swap their drained or already used batteries with fully charged ones at the respective charging stations or outlets. This policy will initially focus on battery swapping for E-scooters, 3-wheelers (autos), and motorcycles, before proceeding to other EVs. The policy also has incentives for the customers up to 20% of the subscription or the total lease cost of the battery. Watch this video on YouTubePros and cons of battery swappingThe various pros and cons of the battery swapping program proposed by the government are mentioned hereunderProsSome of the key benefits of the battery swapping program are,The charging process is completed within minutes without the need to spend hours waiting for the battery to be charged fully.Companies can set up separate charging stations that can be away from swapping points as per their internal guidelines and cost-benefit analysis that will ultimately benefit their bottom line. Customers will benefit since this will reduce the overall cost of EVS as the cost of the battery will be replaced by the lease cost for the batteryEnhanced battery life conditions as the charging can be in a more controlled environment.Cons The limitations of using the battery-swapping program are mentioned below.No standardized model of battery for different EV manufacturersNeed for an increased number of batteries for charging the same number of EVs in the market.Longer time is usually taken by OEMs for adopting the charging modelThe increased cost of battery leasing over the life of the EVHigher rate of GST applicable on separate battery which is 18% as against any battery sold which is sold along with EV which is charged at 5%. Top EV charging Infrastructure stocks in Indiaa.
