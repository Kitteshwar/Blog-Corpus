Yes, Investment in Real Estate can generate a regular income, and you can see capital appreciation over a period of time. People think Real estate as an investment option is good only because they look only into the returns ignoring the other factors.There are other factors that you need to consider:Risk factor: There is more risk involved if you buy a property, and risk comes in the form of property disputes, your property can be grabbed, finding the tenant becomes difficult.Additional expenses: Incurring more expenses can affect your returns.
