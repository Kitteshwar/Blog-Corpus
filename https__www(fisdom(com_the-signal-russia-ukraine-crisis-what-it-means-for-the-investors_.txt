FisdomResearchWritten by - Fisdom ResearchFebruary 18, 2022  5 minutes  The Russia-Ukraine conflict has been highly volatile, and investors in the past few days have panicked because of the ongoing geopolitical tension. But before arriving at the investor’s actionable for the future, let’s first understand some significant developments that led to the current situation between Russia and Ukraine.The year 2008: Ukraine 2008 had initiated talks with North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). NATO was founded in 1949 and is a group of 30 countries from Europe and North America to protect the people and territory of its members.

Ukraine reports that three of its ships were intercepted by the Russian coast guard.November 2021: Satellite images show a growing build-up of Russian troops on Ukrainian borders and 100,000 soldiers with tanks and other military hardware.7th December 2021: US President Joe Biden warns Russia of Western economic sanctions if Ukraine invades.17th December 2021: Russia demands that no membership to admitted to Ukraine by NATO.January 2022: US President Joe Biden assures Ukraine President that they will respond decisively if Russia attempts to invade.

Some Western nations have started evacuating non-essential embassy staff from Kyiv. The US puts 8,500 troops on alert.President Joe Biden warns of a likely invasion in February.

Hence, any disruption in exports due to the conflict or sanctions imposed can drive up commodity prices and put the already disrupted global supply chain in turmoil. Below are some of the critical products where Russia has a strongholdRussia has the highest share in the global market for Palladium. This is an essential element used in emission control devices for automobiles. Hence this could have a significant impact on the auto supply chain and result in soaring prices.

Therefore, any unprecedented situation between them could result in lower production and a shortage in supply, and a subsequent increase in prices.An invasion by Russia on Ukraine would likely drive up the already high cost of living, even slowdown the economic recovery and perhaps rattle portfolios of investors. Supply is already on the fall to keep up with demand and investors are on high alert for any further supply shortages that could emerge through in a variety of ways, including damaged goods from infrastructure in war, sanctions on Russia trying to make energy exports their weapon.What should Indian investors do?The ongoing conflict undoubtedly impacts the stock market.
