These changes are effective from 1st July, 2017.Note: The deadline to file ITR has been extended to 5th August, 2017Here are the few changes & the thoughts behind them-Disclosure of Aadhaar Number: Now Aadhaar number is mandatory for filing income tax return. You must mention the 12-digit Aadhaar number or the 28-digit Aadhaar enrolment number while filing the income tax return. Till last year it was optional to mention the Aadhaar number while filing the return.Why? This is in an attempt to ensure wider coverage under the vision  of having an all-pervasive unique identification for all citizens.Prelinking Aadhaar and PAN card: Both Aadhaar and PAN have already been made mandatory for filing tax returns, opening of bank accounts and financial transactions over Rs 50,000.Why? Linking Aadhar with PAN is expected to help check tax evasion through use of multiple PAN cardsDisclosure of cash deposited more than Rs. 2 lakhs: To account for those who have deposited Rs 2 lakh or more in a bank account during the demonetisation period, the tax department has introduced a new column where the person filing the tax will have to give details of the money deposited and bank account. If a person has deposited Rs 2 lakh or more he or she will mention the IFSC code, name of bank, account number along with the amount deposited in the income tax return.Why? This is to keep track of all deposits during the demonetisation and aid surveillance to ensure maximum tax coverage and fair disclosures.Changes in ITR form numbers:Join our Fin Insight Community  Tax Saving Investments  What Are The Best Tax Saving Option For Senior Citizens for 2023-24? 03 Apr  7 minutes   Tax Saving Investments  How to Check EPFO E-Passbook Status & Claim Status? 31 Mar  6 minutes   Tax Saving Investments  What is EPF Form 5? – How to Fill Form 5 & How to Make Corrections? 24 Mar  5 minutes   Tax Saving Investments  What is i-SIP & How to Add i-SIP Biller in Axis Bank? 23 Mar  7 minutes   Tax Saving Investments  Last Minute Tax Saving Investment Ideas for FY 2022-23 20 Mar  8 minutes   Tax Saving Investments  Best ways to save tax under the old tax regime 01 Mar  8 minutes   Tax Saving Investments  EPF Form 19 – How to Fill EPF Withdrawal Form? 20 Feb  7 minutes   Tax Saving Investments  Senior Citizen Savings Scheme(SCSS)-working, interest rate, deposit limit, eligibility criteria 03 Feb  7 minutes   Tax Saving Investments  How to Download and Fill Form 15G For PF Withdrawal 30 Jan  7 minutes   Tax Saving Investments  Best Tax saving options for the Self-Employed Individuals in 2023 08 Jan  6 minutes   Tax Saving Investments  What should you do with your PPF account after 15 years? 07 Sep  6 minutes   Tax Saving Investments  Common Tax Saving Mistakes that You Should Avoid at the Last Moment 25 Mar  6 minutes
