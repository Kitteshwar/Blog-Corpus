These funds pool money from investors and invest in diversified securities including equities, bonds, commodities, etc while tracking an underlying index.An ETF tracks an index like the Sensex or Nifty by investing in securities in the same weights as the index. ETFs are tradeable in the market. An investor needs to have a Demat account for investing in an ETF and executing any buy or sell transactions.Advantages of Investing in ETFsSome of the known benefits of ETFs are:Low CostETFs are preferred investment options because of their cost efficiency. The expense ratio of an ETF is often lower than 0.5% as compared to 2-2.5% that most actively managed equity funds charge. Lower fund management fee translates into incremental savings and therefore increased payouts for investors in the long-run.LiquidityETFs are marketable securities that can be traded on registered indexes. Since these can be bought and sold at any time during trading hours, these offer higher liquidity in global markets when compared to regular mutual funds. TransparentETFs track an underlying index and the stocks held within the portfolio along with the proportion is known to investors. For example, the Nifty 50 comprises the 50 largest listed companies in India by market capitalisation. An ETF based on Nifty 50 will invest in these exact companies and in the same weights as the Nifty. The portfolio will also be rebalanced in case of changes in the index composition.No Manual InterventionSince Exchange-Traded Funds track an Index, the fund manager’s investment decisions are not required. Therefore, ETFs are less affected by fund manager’s decisions or related errors. While these are prone to tracking errors, it can be usually ignored because of the quantum of impact.Diversity Indian ETFs track diverse indexes such as Nifty, Gold, Nifty Next 50, Nifty Low Vol 20 Index among others. Active mutual funds rarely track such products.Limitations of ETF InvestmentSome of the drawbacks of ETFs are:Limited Chances of Outperforming the MarketETFs do not aim to outperform the market since the idea is to passively track an index. An actively managed fund, on the other hand, has chances of generating higher returns than the index, especially in emerging markets like India.Limited Growth OpportunitiesSince indexes like Nifty and Sensex mostly comprise mature companies, ETFs cannot tap the potential of companies that are in the growth stage and can generate higher returns, especially the ones in the small and mid-cap segments.Requirement of Demat and Trading AccountETF investments require demat and trading accounts. Therefore, it may not be practical for investors who do not have these accounts. Mutual fund investors may not have such accounts as these are often not required for mutual fund investments.Types of ETFsSome of the common types of ETFs available for investment are:Equity ETF These ETFs invest in shares of companies that are equity-focused.

In comparison, stocks limit an investor’s portfolio to specific sectors that may also increase the sector-wise risk within the portfolio.Are ETFs good for beginners?Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) may not be suited for beginner investors since these are passive investments that require a certain level of knowledge of the markets and functioning or composition of the index chosen.Are ETFs good for long-term investing?ETFs are ideal for long-term investing since there is very little turnover of the portfolio of underlying securities.
