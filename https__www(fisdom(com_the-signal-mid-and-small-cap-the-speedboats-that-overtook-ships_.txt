Both midcap & smallcap indices too recovered by 27 per cent & 16 per cent, respectively. Some individual stocks have gone up by more than 100 per cent.The above chart depicts that the midcap & smallcap indices recovered quickly compared to the nifty. Let’s understand the factors impeding this rally and why street estimates favour mid and small caps.Attractive Valuations: Even with the recent rally, Nifty Midcap 100 index now trades at a 16 per cent premium to Nifty 50 indices at 24.8x, whereas the Nifty Small cap 100 index trades at a discount of 14 per cent at 18.4x. And as per street estimates, valuations are at a premium compared to global peers; however, strong double-digit earnings growth for the segment justifies valuations to some extent. Valuations of several large-cap stocks looked stretched while most mid and small-caps are still attractive. It has triggered a rotation of money in mid and small caps, helping the broader market rally.2. A shift towards cyclical:Favourable government policies focus on boosting investments through heavy CAPEX plans to expand the manufacturing sector. Government initiatives like GST compensation and multisector production linked incentives (PLI) schemes are likely to create a robust ecosystem for the manufacturing sector.Capacity utilization has risen for the last three quarters and has remained well above the long-term average of 73.2 per cent at 75.3 in June 2022.Real estate, the most significant contributor to the CAPEX cycle, has shown a strong revival. The housing market has shown considerable improvement amid a surge in demand for residential property, multi-year low inventory levels, and decadal high consumer spending.Overall multi-sectoral drivers and favourable domestic economic conditions will likely make the investment cycle broader and more prominent, directly impacting the earnings revival of niche segments of small and mid-cap players with solid balance sheetsMost midcap & smallcap indices are mostly cyclical oriented. Logistics, real estate, auto ancillaries, construction, and capital goods sector have a deeper presence in broader markets & investors get stock from these sectors in midcap & smallcap spaces. Given the optimism around the cyclical sector and government initiatives, as mentioned above, these stocks are grabbing the attention of investors.Let us have a look at the below chart to see the percentage share of the sector in each market cap bucket:Read our coverage on auto ancillary, consumer durables and banking segments if interested.Also, existing investors are holding on to their current positions and refusing to sell them in the market, expecting even higher prices. Low floating stocks mean that as new money pours into this space, stocks zoom higher in a short period.The following is the list of the top five better-known midcaps & smallcap stocks that have gained more than 25 per cent since the start of CY22. The recent positive trigger in these stocks is due to the acceleration in the china+1 strategy, shift towards formalisation, and market share gains due to disruption.Top performing five midcap stocks:Stock NameAbsolute YTD ChangeMutual Fund Investment – Market Value (cr)Adani Total Gas105.0%₹ 151TATA Elxsi49.1%₹ 1,345Trent34.3%₹ 4,417Coromandel Intl34.1%₹ 4,632AU Small Finance Bank26.5%₹ 5,329Data as on 14th Sept 2022.

It is better to accumulate stocks/mutual funds in a staggered manner through the SIP or STP route rather than putting a significant amount through a one-time route. Based on the sector’s buzz/tips or momentum, abstain from buying small and midcap stocks.Markets this week12th September 2022 (Open)16th September 2022 (Close)%ChangeNifty 5017,89117,531-2.0%Sensex59,91258,841-1.8%Source: BSE & NSEMarkets ended the week on a negative note.India’s leading technology companies have shed a combined market cap of Rs.1.6 trillion in the last four trading sessions amid the volatility in global markets post-release of US inflation numbers.Several rating agencies have revised their forecasts for India’s economic growth post-June quarter GDP numbers.Post Higher than expected US inflation data for August, market participants are now expecting aggressive rate hikes by the US Fed.
