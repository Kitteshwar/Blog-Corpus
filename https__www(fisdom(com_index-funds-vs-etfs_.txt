The idea is to let a fund manager decide on the allocation of funds across various securities. There are also funds that are passively managed but can provide benefits that are similar to a mutual fund. Two examples of passive fund management are Index funds and ETFs. Passive management of funds should not be mistaken as zero involvement of fund managers. These do have fund managers, but, since the funds follow an index, there is no requirement of manual selection of securities by the fund manager.Funds that follow passive investing aim to mirror the chosen index. For investors who are unaware of details about index funds and ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds), it can be confusing to choose between the two. Here, we will discuss all the factors surrounding Index funds and ETFs to allow investors to make a wise investment decision and choose an ideal option as per their investment goals.What are Index Funds?Definition An index fund portfolio is designed to match the components of the chosen market index.
