Grey market in India ExplainedGrey markets have long been in existence in India as parallel markets for trading stocks. These markets primarily function on the demand and supply situation to allow traders and retail investors to trade in shares before these are actually listed.Here are some of the instances when investors can use the grey market for investments:If an investor has invested in an IPO and wants to exit it for some reason, the grey market can provide an opportunity to do so. Investors can also buy IPO shares through the grey market despite missing the IPO deadline. Before listing its stocks and applications, a company can trade the same in the grey market. Grey markets also allow underwriters to better understand a company’s path once it is listed. Many unlisted shares in India reportedly trade at 15-20 times higher than their projected IPO price.Grey market terminologiesGrey market stockA grey market stock is a company’s stock that is unofficially offered and bid by traders. If a company chooses to offer its stock in the grey market before the shares are issued through Initial Public Offering or IPO, it is known as a Grey Market Stock.A very small set of traders deal in the grey market stock and such trades are carried out based on mutual trust among individuals. In India, this type of trading in the grey market stocks is not considered illegal but is not regulated by SEBI. Such trades cannot be settled until the commencement of official trading.Grey market premiumThe price commanded by IPO shares in the grey market is known as grey market premium. The stocks of a company that comes up with an IPO may be bought and sold in parallel to the official stock markets. With the help of grey market premium, investors and other stakeholders can gauge how the IPO will perform on its listing day.Let’s take an example to understand how the grey market premium works. Suppose the issue price of a stock A is Rs. 200. The grey market premium for the same is Rs. 300. This indicates that investors are willing to buy the shares of Company A at Rs. 500 (200+300). Thus, the grey market premium of any IPO will depend on its demand.What is the process of trading in IPO shares through the Grey Market?Here are the key steps involved in the trading of IPO shares in a grey market:Investors first apply for shares through IPO. While doing so, investors take on some amount of financial risk, as shares may be allocated below the issue price. These investors are sellers in the grey market. Some investors may find the share value to be higher than its issue price. Therefore, they take these shares before allocation via IPO allotment process. These sets of investors form the buyers in the grey market.The buyers in the grey market place an order for IPO shares at a percentage premium.Dealers in the grey market will then reach out to the sellers who would have applied for IPO and request them to sell their stocks at a grey market premium.Sellers who want to avoid the risk of stock market listing may sell their IPO shares to a grey market dealer.The dealer then notifies the buyer about the shares purchased.If the seller gets allotted the IPO shares, he/she can decide whether to transfer it to the buyer’s Demat account since most grey market deals are based on trust.The deal is considered canceled in case no shares are allocated to the seller.Types of trading in grey marketIn India, there are a few types of trading that take place in the grey market:IPO Grey Market Trading: This type of trading involves the buying and selling of shares of a company before they are listed on a stock exchange.
