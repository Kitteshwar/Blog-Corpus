MarishaBhattWritten by - Marisha BhattSeptember 7, 2022  6 minutes  The need for government-issued documents is quite extensive and the most common of them is meeting the KYC requirements of various public and private organizations. For such KYC requirements or verifications, we often provide our PAN Card or Aadhaar Card without any second thought. We often hear about the misuse of such documents but never suspect it to happen to us. This is one of our biggest mistakes as there have been many documented cases where the photocopy of the Aadhaar card has been gravely misused and the cardholder is left to face the consequences of the same. To resolve these issues, the Aadhaar issuing authority has urged the Aadhaar cardholders to use masked Aadhaar.   Table of Contents  hide   1 What is an Aadhaar Number and why is it important?   2 What is masked Aadhaar?   3 How can masked Aadhaar prevent misuse of the document?   4 What is the process to download masked Aadhaar?   5 Conclusion   6 FAQs Given below is the meaning of masked Aadhaar and how it can be used to prevent any misuse of this important document. What is an Aadhaar Number and why is it important?Aadhaar Card was launched in the year 2009 by the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) under the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology. Aadhaar Card was introduced with the aim to provide a unique identification number to every citizen of the country which will help them get direct benefits from all the government incentives and schemes that are introduced from time to time. The concept of the Aadhaar Card was based on the social security number that is provided to every citizen of the US where the government benefits are directly linked and transferred to the social security number of the valid recipient. Aadhar Card has the primary details of cardholders like their name, address, gender, mobile number, date of birth, etc. What is masked Aadhaar?As mentioned above, the Aadhaar card holds many vital details of a person that can be misused if fallen into the wrong hands. To prevent this from happening UIDAI had issued an advisory to use masked Aadhaar in the case when there is no need to provide the complete Aadhaar number. The masked Aadhaar is the copy of the e-Aadhaar where only the last four digits of the Aadhar number are visible. This protects the crucial details of the cardholder as well as the Aadhaar number.
