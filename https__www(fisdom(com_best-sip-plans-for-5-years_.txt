Investors have to first select their target funds to start SIP plans. The next step is to set a target date and the amount of SIP that is to be debited from the bank account at periodic intervals (usually per month). On such date, the amount will be debited from the investor’s bank account and additional units of the fund will be added to the investor’s portfolio. The number of units to be added will depend on the prevailing NAV. There are three types of SIPs for investors to choose from. These are top-up SIPs (increasing the SIPs by a fixed percentage at regular intervals), flexible SIPs (flexibility to alter the SIP plan based on the availability of funds), and perpetual SIPs (SIP investments till perpetuity). Read more: How do perpetual SIPs work?Top SIP plans for 5 years in FY 23-24Investing in long term investments plans that usually have an investment horizon of 5 years or more can be done easily through SIPs.

Some of the key benefits of investing through SIPs are highlighted below. Lower capital investment The top advantage of investing through SIPs is the lower capital investment. Investors can start creating their portfolio with nominal amounts and therefore, it is easily accessible to every investor. Many investors who usually do not have a sufficient corpus to invest in a lumpsum manner often tend to procrastinate their investments. SIPs are an excellent option to start investments and eventually achieve the goal of wealth creation. Flexibility of investment Investment through SIPs allows the investors the flexibility to invest on their own terms. Investors can start a SIP at any point and can exit the same based on their individual discretion. Also, depending on the availability of the funds and the prevailing market conditions, investors can modify their SIPs as well as increase or decrease the same. Benefit of compoundingThe golden rule of investing through SIPs is to start as early as possible to gain maximum advantage from the fund. By investing early, investors can get the maximum benefit of compounding and increase their wealth at a relatively faster pace. Benefit of Rupee Cost Averaging Another important advantage of investing through SIPs is the benefit of Rupee Cost Averaging. This essentially implies that investing a constant amount periodically irrespective of market trends will allow the investors to eventually average out the cost of units purchased. To achieve this benefit it is imperative that the SIPs be continued for an extended period of time. Discipline to save and invest regularly Most investors, especially young and new investors who have recently started earning, often find it difficult to save and invest regularly. By investing in mutual funds through SIPs, such young investors can inculcate a disciplined habit of saving and investing which can eventually help them in increasing their savings and investing aggressively. How are SIPs taxed 2023? The taxation of SIPs is similar to the taxation of mutual funds based on their dominant asset class.
