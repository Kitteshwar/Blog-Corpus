Investors can buy and sell units of a fund at the NAV (Net Asset Value) which is updated on the stock exchanges every day. These funds can be highly liquid assets (except ELSS funds that come with a lock-in of 3years) and can be efficiently used to meet investment goals of varying tenures. The primary classification of mutual funds includes equity-oriented funds, debt-oriented funds, and hybrid funds. What are the objectives of mutual funds in India?Some of the common objectives of mutual funds in India are highlighted below. Professional ManagementThe primary objective of mutual funds is to provide professional management of investments to individual and institutional investors. Mutual fund managers have expertise in selecting and managing investments across different asset classes such as equity, debt, and money market instruments based on their internal investment model that is fine-tuned to achieve the objective of the fund. DiversificationMutual funds offer investors the benefits of diversification, which is achieved by investing across different sectors and asset classes. This helps in reducing the overall risk of the portfolio and ensuring a well-diversified investment that can provide better returns that are also often inflation adjusted.Capital protectionCapital protection is one of the key features or primary objectives of many mutual funds. This is an important investment criterion, especially for risk-averse investors. The risk of investment in these funds is quite lower and so are the returns as compared to the more aggressive funds like pure equity funds or aggressive hybrid funds.LiquidityMutual funds offer investors the flexibility to redeem their investments at any time, which provides liquidity to the investors. This makes it a crucial benefit for investors who allocate a part of their emergency fund in mutual funds. ConvenienceInvesting in mutual funds is easy and convenient. Investors can buy or sell units of a mutual fund scheme through online platforms, agents, or distributors, and even directly from the mutual fund company. Furthermore, investors also have the option to invest through the SIP mode or through the lumpsum investment mode as per their capital availability. This makes it highly flexible for the investors ensuring maximum participation across investor categories. What are the functions of mutual funds in India?Mutual funds in India are charged with many key functions which are highlighted hereunder. Investment ManagementMutual funds are charged with the function of collecting money from investors and using it to invest in a diversified portfolio of securities like stocks, bonds, and money market instruments in varied proportions based on their asset allocation model.

This helps investors in making informed decisions about their investment portfolio. Risk ManagementMutual funds are required to manage the overall risk of the fund by diversifying the portfolio across different sectors and asset classes and using prudent risk management techniques to align the risk of the funds with the investor expectations. ConvenienceMutual funds provide a convenient and flexible way for investors to invest in a diversified portfolio of securities.
