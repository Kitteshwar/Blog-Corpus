Choose from the two Government initiatives, NPS or SCSS AkshathaSajumonWritten by - Akshatha SajumonMarch 2, 2019  8 minutes “Retirement is when you stop living at work and start working at living.”A frequent question in the minds of people today is: Do I have enough funds to retire? What will I do when I retire?The whole point of getting high degrees, building a decent career, aiming for high salaries, saving incomes, making a wise investment and various other activities in our life are done with the intention to have a peaceful lifestyle once we retire.We commonly hear our parents say, “I don’t want to be dependent on my children when I retire” or “I want to go on a European trip when I retire” and many such aspirations. Some have financial desires and some just want to be financially independent rather than being a burden to anyone.Besides, retirement is a stage everybody goes through in their life, be it a government or a non-government employee.  To provide for all these needs, it is genuine that retired or senior citizens wish for post-retirement income. This is when small saving schemes provided by the Government of India becomes absolutely necessary.One such Scheme is:“Senior Citizen Savings Scheme”.The Senior Citizens Savings Scheme (SCSS) is a scheme protected and backed by the Government of India to provide regular income for senior citizens of India. Since it is provided by the Government, this scheme is a risk-free tax saving investment, which is generally preferred amongst the retired audience.“National Pension System (NPS)”The National Pension System (NPS) is yet another instrument provided by the Government of India, with the intention to provide pension opportunity to every Indian and to inculcate the habit of saving especially for retirement.This article aims at answering a few typical questions that senior citizens would have about SCSS and why one should consider NPS as a better option.Who can invest in these instruments?One has to be a citizen of India to be eligible for SCSS.Must fulfill any one of the below age criteria: a). Senior citizen aged 60 years or above. b). Retirees who have opted for the Voluntary Retirement Scheme (VRS) or Superannuation with the age between 55-60.c). Retired defense personnel with a minimum age of 50 years. Note: HUFs and NRIs are not allowed to invest in this scheme.  With NPS, the criteria are simple: Any person between the age of 18 – 65 years can open an NPS account.  What should my investment amount be?    The minimum amount required for an investment in SCSS is Rs.1000.    The maximum amount should be the lower of the two: An individual can invest up to 15 lakhs An individual can invest the amount received as a retirement benefit.If it’s a joint account with a spouse, then the maximum amount is 30 lakhs.The investment amount of NPS varies between 500 to 1000, depending on the type of NPS (Tier 1 or Tier II) you belong to. And there is no upper limit to the amount you can invest in NPS. Read More on: Types of NPS options?The investment should be done by cheque or cash?The SCSS account can be opened by cash or cheque.
