They aim to provide investors with a diversified portfolio by investing in a mix of different asset classes like equities, bonds, and cash equivalents. The fund managers actively manage the portfolio and adjust the allocation based on market conditions. The objective is to achieve capital appreciation while managing risk. Asset allocation funds can have different risk profiles, ranging from aggressive to conservative. They generate returns through capital appreciation, interest income, and dividends. The taxation of these funds depends on the holding period, with different tax rates for short-term and long-term gains.
