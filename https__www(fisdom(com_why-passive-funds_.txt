The investor only needs to cope with the market risk and nothing additional. One can easily create long-term wealth just by investing in a market index and past performance of the index can be a testimony to that.Investing in a passive fund is simpler and involves fewer decisions to be taken based on the past performance of the fund manager, the stock selection strategy, market conditions etc. The lackluster performance of active funds has also contributed to the increased investment in passive funds.How are Passive Funds Gaining Trust?The Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI) observed that index funds had gathered an AUM of Rs. 7,717 crores as of November 2019.
