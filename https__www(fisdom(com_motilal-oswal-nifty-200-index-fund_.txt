Investors can subscribe to this fund from 21st Jan 2022 to 4th February 2022. Investment objective of the fundThis fund is an open-ended scheme with Nifty 200 Momentum 30 TRI as its benchmark and aims to track its performance subject to tracking errors. The scheme does not guarantee minimum returns or achievement of the scheme objectives. Why should you invest in this fund?DiversificationThe fund requires a minimum of 95% investment in Constituents of Nifty 200 Momentum 30 Index and balance in Liquid schemes, debt schemes, and money market instruments (like reverse repos, Commercial  Deposit, Commercial Paper, Treasury Bills, and Tri-Party Repos). The momentum stocks on the benchmark are selected based on their normalized momentum score. This score is determined based on 6-month and 12-month price adjusted for volatility.Apart from this the scheme also aims to invest in derivative markets (Index Futures, Stock Futures, Index Options, Stock Options, etc.) and any other instrument permitted by SEBI from time to time. This increases the benefit of diversification at the same time spreading the risk of investment making it an ideal investment option for investors with a lower risk appetite. Passively managed fundThe scheme falls under the category of passively managed funds. Since the fund tracks the performance of Nifty 200 Momentum 30, returns are more or less consistent with that of the index subject to tracking errors. The risk of this fund is quite high but the inherent benefit of diversification (available in any index fund) makes it a better investment option in comparison to equity funds in general. Low investment costThe NFO is priced at Rs. 10 per unit and investors can invest in the fund with a minimum investment amount of Rs. 500 (in multiples of Re. 1 thereafter). Also, the fund does not have any entry load and the exit load of the fund is at 1% if the units are redeemed within 15 days of allotment. LiquidityThe scheme allows the investors to have easy redemption of units at applicable NAV. An important point to note is that the scheme pays a penal interest of 15% p.a. or the relevant applicable rate if the redemption proceeds are not given within 10 days of receipt of the redemption request.Plan optionsThe scheme is available in direct plans as well as regular plans where investors can subscribe to the fund directly through the fund house or through a distributor respectively. Each plan offers a growth plan where the returns are reinvested in the fund ultimately resulting in higher returns for the investors. Fund DetailsScheme nameMotilal Oswal Nifty 200 Momentum 30 Index FundType of SchemeAn open-ended index scheme investing in the composition of Nifty 200 Momentum 30 Index Category of the schemeIndex fundBenchmarkNifty 200 Momentum 30 Index Plan optionsRegular planDirect plan Each plan has a growth optionFund ManagerMr. Swapnil MayekarMr. Abhiroop MukherjeeExit Load1% if redeemed within 15 days of allotmentMinimum InvestmentDuring NFO: Rs. 500 and multiples of Re 1 thereafterAdditional purchase: Minimum Rs. 500 and multiples of Re. 1 thereafterNFO Period21 Jan – 04 Feb 2022  New Fund Offers(NFO)  ICICI Pru Innovation Fund NFO 12 Apr  5 minutes   New Fund Offers(NFO)  TAX SAVER FUND White Oak  NFO – 2023 09 Jan  9 minutes   New Fund Offers(NFO)  [Updated[ ICICI Pru Tpt & Logistics Fund -202 01 Dec  9 minutes   New Fund Offers(NFO)  HDFC Business Cycle NFO Review 22 Nov  8 minutes   New Fund Offers(NFO)  Baroda BNP Multi Asset NFO Review 22 Nov  8 minutes   New Fund Offers(NFO)  IDFC Tpt & Logistics Fund 06 Oct  10 minutes   New Fund Offers(NFO)  Union Retirement Fund NFO Review 15 Sep  8 minutes   New Fund Offers(NFO)  Kotak Business Cycles Fund NFO 15 Sep  7 minutes   New Fund Offers(NFO)  IDFC Nifty100 Low Volatility 30 Index Fund 15 Sep  7 minutes   New Fund Offers(NFO)  ICICI Prudential Nifty50 Equal Weight Index Fund NFO 15 Sep  7 minutes   New Fund Offers(NFO)  Edelweiss Gold & Silver ETF FOF NFO 02 Sep  7 minutes   New Fund Offers(NFO)  ICICI Pru PSU Equity Fund NFO 02 Sep  7 minutes
