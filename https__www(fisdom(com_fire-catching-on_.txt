It helps an individual carefully assess things that are the most important to oneself and how one can achieve financial freedom such that personal decisions are not governed by finances or money at all times.Many principles of this movement, like saving and spending, consciously may be universal, but there can be a stark difference between how one adopts these in personal life and the final outcome.Did you know?In India, 67% of retired individuals continue to work for a living. Every 7 in 10 adults depends on their children post retirement. Does this not act as a signal for millennials to seriously consider their income and retirement planning? (Source –  Economic Times )Principles of FIREThe concept of FIRE is based on principles including higher saving, simplicity of living, and planning for a passive income for early retirement. However, FIRE may not always involve adopting a minimalist approach. Similarly, an early retirement need not be the ultimate goal in one’s life.The focus is on giving oneself the financial freedom to choose what interests an individual, be it an early retirement, working towards a hobby, working part time, taking up an alternate career that is now financially affordable. How can you achieve early retirement?To adopt the FIRE movement positively in your life, here are some of the important factors to consider while financially planning your retirement:Know what retirement means: As a first step, you must envision what an ideal retirement should look like for you. It is important to determine whether you want to continue working post retirement or entirely stop working.Estimate expenses: You must also gauge your approximate annual expenses. By keeping a note of every outflow, you can arrive at a precise number that will help in planning your retirement easily.Adopt simplicity: To build a substantial retirement corpus, you may have to aggressively save and invest. This means you have to focus on significantly lowering your monthly expenses by adopting an inexpensive lifestyle. Focus on investments: It can be difficult or impossible to save enough for retirement without having any passive income source. Thus, it makes sense to invest in financial avenues that can offer reasonable and stable returns. This must be planned early on in life, especially in terms of choosing from options like Public Provident Funds (PPFs), mutual funds, national pension scheme, etc.Clear debt: Ensure that all your outstanding debt is paid off before the age of 40. This is because you may want to avoid having any such big-ticket financial responsibility post retirement.How much money will you need in retirement in India?As per the FIRE approach, if you wish for early retirement in India, you will need to have at least 30 times the money that you spend yearly. So, how much money is that? Let’s take an example to understand the workings.Suppose your present age is 27 years and you spend about Rs. 55,000 per month. If you want to aim for retirement at 42 years, you have about 15 years to begin accumulating funds for your retirement. By taking the inflation rate as 6%, the monthly expenses will be around Rs. 1.30 lakhs by the time you turn 42. Therefore, you will require Rs. 15.72 lakhs per year to cater to your lifestyle needs.Thus, to attain financial freedom, it will be ideal for you to have around Rs. 5 crores by the age of 42. This number may not be possible to reach with savings alone. Although savings will be needed, you will also need to start investing in profitable avenues at the earliest. By selecting a financial investment option that offers an annual compound interest of 9%, you may be able to accumulate the desired funds in 15 years. ConclusionIt is possible to achieve financial freedom by starting your investment journey early on in life. While this is important, it does not necessarily mean that you must compromise on your lifestyle needs. By creating a substantial retirement corpus combined with proper financial planning through diversified investments, you can still achieve early retirement. FIRE is not about denying yourself a leisure trip or never buying a high-end phone. It is about making financial adjustments that can let you enjoy your retirement in the right way.FAQsIs the FIRE approach realistic?FIRE is a realistic approach if one follows a certain level of financial discipline that is required to achieve financial independence and early retirement.
