The contributions made by you as an employee and your employer throughout the period of your employment under the EPF scheme forms the EPF or Employees’ Provident Fund, which you can use after your retirement. Making these contributions per month helps you save a portion of your salary for using it in the long run.These monthly contributions made by you and your employer go into trusts formed by the following three schemes which are in act under the EPF Act of 1952:Employees’ Provident Fund Scheme ( EPF) 1952Employees’ Deposit Linked Insurance Scheme (EDLI) 1976Employees’ Pension Scheme (EPS) 1995While your contribution as an employee will go only in the EPF, your employer’s contribution goes to EPF, EPS and EDLI.The following table shows the distribution of the employees’ and employer’s contributions:Contribution by:Scheme EPFEPSEDLIEmployee12%0%0%Employer3.67%8.33%0.5%The above contributions are made out of the employees’ salary.For example: Naina has a monthly salary of Rs. 20,000. Accordingly, 12% of her salary, that is Rs. 2,400 will go into the EPF as her contribution. While her employer will make a contribution of Rs. 734 in the EPF as that is the 3.67% of her salary amount.Benefits of EPFEmployees get a fixed rate of interest added to their EPF account at the end of every year and also some added benefits at the time of its maturity.Employees who use the EPF schemes get tax benefits and are eligible for tax exemption of up to Rs. 1.5 lakh.EPF is a great investment for emergencies as there is an option available for premature withdrawal. The employee can withdraw a partial amount of the EPF to meet their needs at the time.It’s a good investment to secure your post retirement life as a part of your contribution directly goes to the Employees’ Pension Fund (EPS) without you having to pay any extra money.What is NPS?Securing your income post retirement so as to enjoy a worry free retired life is a goal of almost every person. NPS or National Pension Scheme is one of the schemes that helps you with it. It is a long term investment scheme introduced by the government of India under Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA).Using this scheme you can invest money in regular amounts throughout your working life and use the accumulated amount after your retirement. You can withdraw a certain percentage of the accumulated amount while the remaining amount will be given to you as pension on a regular basis.This scheme is especially good for people who have long term financial goals as there aren’t many short term benefits associated with this scheme. The people working in the private sector can use this scheme to secure their post retirement income.There are two choice options when it comes to investing in NPS— auto choice and active choice.In auto choice the investment is chosen for you based on your profile, your age, past investments, etc. In active choice you can actively choose your investment.Types of NPS AccountsThere are two types of NPS accounts— Tier I account and Tier II account.
