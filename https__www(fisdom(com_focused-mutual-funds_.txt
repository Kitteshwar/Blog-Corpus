These funds seek to maximize returns by investing in limited but high performing assets with tremendous growth potential.How do focused mutual funds work?As per SEBI guidelines, a focused mutual fund can invest in up to 30 stocks. However, there are no such restrictions on other equity funds. Different categories of equity funds, generally, have 50 to 100 stocks in their portfolios.

Such segregation may or may not be there in other types of equity mutual funds.DiversificationFocused funds can invest in any sector and any company. They are free to choose a large-cap, mid-cap, or small-cap company to invest in. Thus, this gives the added benefit of diversification to the investors.Here are some disadvantages of investing in focused mutual funds:High risk: Focused mutual funds can be riskier than other types of mutual funds due to their concentrated portfolio.Lack of diversification: Focused mutual funds have a concentrated portfolio of no more than 30 stocks. This lack of diversification can be a disadvantage.Market volatility: Focused mutual funds are more susceptible to market volatility than other types of mutual funds due to their concentrated portfolio.Why should one invest in focused mutual funds?The fundamental objective of equity mutual funds is to give investors the benefit of diversification. But too much diversification does not help investors as can result in lower returns. This is where focused mutual funds come in handy. The same focused fund’s approach is to pick the right stocks and earn high returns for the investors.There is also a downside as far as focused funds are concerned. There is also an increased risk that the investors are exposed to when the fund aims for high returns. Too much emphasis on a limited group of stocks can either hit the jackpot or completely go against the investors’ interest. To mitigate such risks, fund managers of focused funds, in general, employ a top-down strategy to select sectors and stocks that are potential outperformers.Who should invest in Focused Mutual Funds?As we know, focused funds invest in a small number of stocks, and these stocks can be very volatile. Therefore, focused mutual funds are suitable for seasoned investors or individuals who have a high-risk appetite. Focused mutual funds have high risk as the returns may be much lower than the benchmarks because of their very nature. So, risk-averse investors or individuals looking for safe investment tools should avoid investing in these funds.  Aggressive investors looking for high returns may consider investing in such funds as they can give high returns. Investors should keep a long-term horizon of at least 5 years to get the maximum benefit from these funds.If you are looking to invest in focused mutual funds, here are a few points you should consider:RiskAs discussed earlier, focused funds are risky as the entire corpus is invested in a basket of around 30 stocks. The risk is much higher than other equity mutual funds like a multi-cap fund, etc. Investors should understand that the returns earned on their investments may be lower than the market returns or vice versa.CostThere is an inherent cost attached to all mutual fund schemes in the form of an expense ratio. The expense ratio denotes the percentage of money used to manage the fund. Investors should check all the funds’ expense ratios and select the one with a low expense ratio. A low expense ratio means higher returns for the investors.Time PeriodAs stated earlier, focused funds can be very volatile in the short term. So individuals should avoid these funds if they are investing for a short period. Thus, these funds are suitable for investors who have the patience to invest for the long term, i.e., at least 5 years.Tax ImplicationsThe tax treatment on focused funds is similar to any other equity-oriented mutual fund. If an investor is holding these funds for more than one year, the gains will be long-term and taxed at 10 percent. If the holding period is less than one year, the gains will be taxed at 15 percent. So it is better to invest in such funds for the long term to maximise the returns and tax benefits.Focused funds or concentrated funds are high risks funds suitable for experienced investors. But the most significant advantage that stands out is the potential for higher returns. These funds are becoming an attractive option for new age investors as well. Such aggressive investors invest in these funds to beat the market returns over a long period. However, they should consider the risks associated and match them with their risk appetite and financial goals.Fund recommendations for Focused mutual fundsHere are the top-performing fund recommendations that investors can consider in this category:Principal Focused Multicap FundSBI Focused Equity FundICICI Prudential Focused Equity FundQuant Focused fundPrincipal Focused Multicap FundAbout FundThe scheme aims to invest in equity and equity related securities in a maximum of 30 stocks at a time.
