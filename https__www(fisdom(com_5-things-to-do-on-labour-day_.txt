It is a truth that doesn’t define Homosapians but it is definitely part of our lives. Truly, every person has to literally earn their right to be treated as a human. Even in indigenous societies across the World, each person plays a role in their own little community. So, are we really privileged as a species or we are just fooling ourselves with luxuries like air-conditioners and fancy sedans named after animals, compensating for having to earn our right to live unless we have ‘trumped’ it all our life with privileges? This labour day let’s look at it as a privilege because we can make our dreams come true with what we earn.

You’ll save money! Although it may not save your money it will definitely reduce the pollution and environmental hazard that the dairy industry is. But, that’s not part of your financial portfolio although it might just improve your health immunity. Honestly, it’s your choice and decision just like it is to ensure that you’re financially alright. This labour day there 5 things you can do for yourself that can help you to improve your financial immunity.1. Plan your taxes carefully: This is one of the most important aspects of your financial portfolio. Are you saving enough on tax? There are multiple ways of saving taxes, such as ELSS-tax-saving funds, insurances or other government-controlled plans such as the National Pension Scheme(NPS). 2.

It is ideal to invest in multiple investment opportunities. But if you are a beginner or new to options such as stock market trading, you can go for mutual funds, based on how much risk you are willing to take.5. Invest wisely; always look at the big picture: Regardless of the tendencies of markets being ‘bearish’ we have to ensure that our personal financial tendencies are ‘bullish’ because inflation is inevitable far more than Thanos is. So, to fight inflation always invest a part of your savings in Gold because not only does it ensure good returns over the years but history has seen becoming more precious by the day.A lot of people think that being financially comfortable is good enough but as humans, we thrive, we dream, we create the existence of passion and perseverance at our workplaces and that makes it all worth it to be alive, working and earning![tek_button button_text=”Download Fisdom App” button_link=”url:https%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2zQjBhX||target:%20_blank|” button_position=”button-center”]   Financial Planning  AI tools for personal finance advice- can you rely on them? 22 May  8 minutes   Financial Planning  Portfolio Rebalancing – What is it?
