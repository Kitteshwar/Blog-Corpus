Nifty and Sensex down this week by 1.24% and 1.72% respectivelyWeekly Capsule– Government rolls out INR. 20 trillion relief package (Prime Minister Modi announced the much-awaited relief package on 12th May which amounts to ~10% of country’s GDP in order to fight the current break in economic activities amid the ongoing lockdown. The package has brought in huge relief to the most hit sectors of economy like MSME’s, migrant workers, farmers and agricultural industry.)– India’s retail inflation in March drops to 4-month low of 5.84% (The retail inflation registered lowest levels for current calendar year at 5.84%, mainly due the food basket price inflation dropping to 8.76% for the month of March compared to 10.81% for the month February.

For now, the market seems to be focused on global cues and continues to remain under pressure as the muted earnings season so far and the relief measures announced by the government have not been able to boost sentiments.Join our Fin Insight Community  The SignalWeekly Dose  The Signal (weekly highlights) 02 Sep  3 minutes   The SignalWeekly Dose  The Signal (weekly highlights) 26 Aug  3 minutes   The SignalWeekly Dose  The Signal (weekly highlights) 19 Aug  4 minutes   The SignalWeekly Dose  The Signal (weekly highlights) 12 Aug  3 minutes   The SignalWeekly Dose  The Signal (weekly highlights) 05 Aug  3 minutes   The SignalWeekly Dose  The Signal (weekly highlights) 29 Jul  3 minutes   Weekly Dose  The Signal (weekly highlights) 27 May  3 minutes   Weekly Dose  The Signal (weekly highlights) 13 May  3 minutes   Weekly Dose  The Signal (weekly highlights) 22 Apr  3 minutes   Weekly Dose  The Signal (weekly highlights) 15 Apr  2 minutes   Weekly Dose  The Signal (weekly highlights) 08 Apr  3 minutes   Weekly Dose  The Signal (weekly highlights) 01 Apr  3 minutes
