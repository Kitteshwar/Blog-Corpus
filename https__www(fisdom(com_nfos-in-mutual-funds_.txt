It is generally done to finance its purchase of mutual fund units. Like an IPO (Initial Public Offer) of a company, an NFO is announced by an AMC (Asset Management Company) to raise capital for launching their new mutual fund scheme. NFO provides all the information about the fund scheme like the shares to be purchased, fund manager details, the benchmark to which the fund will be marked etc.How does an NFO (New Fund Offer) work?When an AMC announces a new fund offer, the public or the investors can purchase the mutual fund units at the subscription price. This subscription price is set at Rs. 10 per unit. According to the SEBI (Securities Exchange Board of India) regulations, a new fund offer can remain active in the market for a maximum period of 30 days. Once the new fund offer period ends, the mutual fund units are allotted to investors who subscribed to the issue.An AMC can utilise the amounts collected in purchasing securities of various listed companies, debt or other commodities as per the Offer document approved by SEBI.
