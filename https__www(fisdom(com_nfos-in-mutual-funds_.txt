It is generally done to finance its purchase of mutual fund units. Like an IPO (Initial Public Offer) of a company, an NFO is announced by an AMC (Asset Management Company) to raise capital for launching their new mutual fund scheme. NFO provides all the information about the fund scheme like the shares to be purchased, fund manager details, the benchmark to which the fund will be marked etc.How does an NFO (New Fund Offer) work?When an AMC announces a new fund offer, the public or the investors can purchase the mutual fund units at the subscription price. This subscription price is set at Rs. 10 per unit. According to the SEBI (Securities Exchange Board of India) regulations, a new fund offer can remain active in the market for a maximum period of 30 days. Once the new fund offer period ends, the mutual fund units are allotted to investors who subscribed to the issue.An AMC can utilise the amounts collected in purchasing securities of various listed companies, debt or other commodities as per the Offer document approved by SEBI. Subscribing to a new fund offer of the mutual fund scheme can be done at the base price of Rs 10. Any increase in the Net Asset Value (NAV) post the initial subscription results in gains for the investors.  Post the NFO period, any transaction of the mutual fund can only be made on the NAV price. Types of NFOs (New Fund Offer)The new fund offers are launched with essentially two types of fund offers, namely, close-ended funds and open-ended funds. Among the many differences between these types of funds is the way they are managed. Open ended funds are usually actively managed funds while close ended funds tend to be passively managed funds. Given below are the details of each such funds. Open-ended FundsThe majority of funds that are offered through NFO are open-ended mutual funds. Open-ended mutual fund schemes do not have any restrictions with respect to the time period of investment or the number of units in the fund. Once the mutual fund starts operating, the fund units can be bought or sold as per the prevailing NAV. Close-ended FundsClose-ended mutual funds are funds that do not allow investment in the fund post the completion of the NFO nor any exit from the fund till the maturity of such fund which is usually 3 years to 4 years. The units of these funds can also be traded in the open market but their liquidity is lower as compared to open ended funds.Watch this video on YouTubeWhat are NFO Benefits?Investment in new fund offers can be advantageous at times. The best part of a new fund offer is that the details regarding the investment objectives, expected return on investment, etc., are provided at the launch time.

If the mutual fund’s objective is matched by the investor’s goals, risk appetite, etc., such investments can be very profitable.

This will help in maximising the returns on their investments and makes the investment approach much more disciplined.Gains on investment As stated earlier, investing in a new fund offer of a mutual fund can be profitable as the units are purchased at a nominal rate. Once the units are traded in the open market, any increase in the NAV can substantially benefit the investors.How can one invest in an NFO (New Fund Offer)?Generally, the new fund offers of the AMC are well marketed. Investors can get the news of a new fund offer on various media channels and also through emails sent by the AMC to the potential investors.
