Credit bureaus issue credit score based on your current and past credit behavior. Lenders use the score to determine your creditworthiness.As a credit card is an unsecured (not backed by a security/asset) credit product, anything that you do with your credit card will affect your credit score. Closure of your credit card can also affect your credit score. Let’s learn how.Can reduce your credit historyVery often, you use the same credit card for several years. When used properly, you also end up building an excellent credit history. A long credit history portrays your creditworthiness over time and adds to your credit score. But, when you close a credit card with a long credit history and you have no other products that contribute to your credit history, your credit score can see a temporary drop. May increase your credit utilization ratioThe credit utilisation ratio is an important component of your credit score calculation. Credit Utilisation Ratio is calculated by dividing your credit card billed amount by the credit limit available on your cards. It is good to keep your credit card utilization between 40-50%. When you close a credit card but do not cut down your expenses, then you end up increasing your credit utilisation ratio on other available cards. A high credit utilization ratio is not good for your credit score. Once you get the intimation of the credit card closure from your credit card issuer, proper disposal of the card is also important. You could cut the card into pieces to avoid misuse. How To Reactivate a Closed or Cancelled ICICI Bank Credit Card?To reactivate their closed or cancelled ICICI Bank credit card, applicants need to call the toll-free customer service number at 1860 120 7777.
