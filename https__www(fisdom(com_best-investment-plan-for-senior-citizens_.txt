These are-  Low risk investment plans with low risks and low returnsMedium risk investment plans with moderate risks and moderate returnsHigh risk investment plans with high risks and high returnsPlease note: risk and return share are directly proportional.As a senior citizen who has fulfilled nearly most or all of his or her responsibilities, the funds at his or her disposal will be used to fulfil their personal needs and medical expenses.
