The fall has been a result of consecutive event spills and investor behavior to forage for “safer” asset classes in time of tries. However pick-up of economic indicators, and foreign monies finding fervor instead of fever, can see the segment lift-off its current comforted levels.On a valuation front, the index has seen sharp contraction of 46% from peaks in 2017.After the big tumble, the segment is gearing up to rumble.
