Typically, companies use their own estimates and calculations to determine the face value of their stocks or bonds. Face value of stocks and bonds plays an important role from the company’s perspective since it helps the organization in estimating the accounting value of these securities.

The company announces a dividend of 10%. Thus, an investor can easily calculate that he/she can receive Re. 1 as dividend per stock as: 10% dividend is applied on the face value of the stock, which is Rs. 10 and not the market value of the stock.What is the impact of face value on stock splits?Many companies announce stock splits to allow more investors to invest in the company. Calculation of stock splits is also based on the face value of shares. Investors must try to understand the impact of face value of a share on a stock split announcement. In simple terms, a stock split is the division of the face value of a share. If, for example:a company announces 1:5 splitFace value of its shares is Rs. 10 The stock split will result in the face value of the stocks becoming Rs. 2 since each share will now be split into 5 shares. While the price of the outstanding shares will fall proportionately, the total number of stock holdings will rise. Thus, more shares will be available for investors after a stock split.Why is face value an important parameter in share markets?Face value plays an important role in various calculations surrounding stocks and bonds.
