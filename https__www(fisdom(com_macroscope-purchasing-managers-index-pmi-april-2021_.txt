Different elements are attributed distinct weights and the resultant index is accepted to be indicative of current business activity and projected confidence levels.Key elements covered by the index include new orders, output, employment, suppliers’ delivery time, and inventory build-up, in descending weights ranging between (30-10) %.The index is considered important as an economic indicator helping compare a country’s activity competitiveness vis-à-vis peers.Update: Manufacturing PMI Reading – April 2021India Manufacturing PMI recorded 55.5 in April after declining to a seven-month low of 55.4 in the month prior. Remaining flat-to-positive, the index remained above its long-run average of 53.6. The manufacturing sector remained surprisingly favorable amidst intensification of the viral virus.A reading above 50 denotes expansion and below 50 denotes contraction.Analyst CommentaryThe manufacturing index in its current avatar strikes a delicate balance between dampening domestic demand and exponential exports.Within borders, output and sales increased at the slowest rates since August 2020 as covidinduced restrictions shook the supply chain systems. A key contributor to this was the steep increase in input costs, with steel playing culprit due to new-found demand across major economies in USA and China. Chemicals, transportation, and energy price-rise further added pressure to the element reading. Such intensity elevated input inflation at its quickest since July 2014, with rate of increase following suit by recording highest figures over seven-&-half years.Vaccination drives trickled positivity over the coming year as business confidence levels, and demand forecasts held strong. The same reflected in actions as businesses rushed to pile-up inventories in spite of cost challenge. In fact, stock pile-up rose for the eighth consecutive month.The rate of fall in manufacturing sector recorded the weakest intensity over the prior thirteen months of consecutive shedding. This marked a major positive for the index.Outside borders, exports marked an eighth consecutive increase as peer countries oiled economic gears to trump economic shocks observed due to Covid-19. The same was reflected in data released by national commerce faction, highlighting India’s record 197% April export growth to $30.21 billion.Key risks are visible in the possible imbalance between rising global prices and domestic case counts. Abruptions in push-&-pull inflations can disrupt stabilizing demand footprints, if costs are levied onto consumers instead of being consumed in the production chain.Going ahead, the widening of vaccination programs will be instrumental in printing manufacturing sector’s next leg of growth. The numbers today highlight the nascent and fragile stage of recovery that the Indian economy is in. We continue to keep an eye on efficient implementation of public policies which can be expected to bolster the economy at large.Click Here to read HIS Markit’s original press release on ‘IHS Markit India Manufacturing PMI’ for the month April, 2021  Macroscope  Macroscope – Government Finances: Way Ahead 04 Jun  1 minute   Macroscope  Macroscope – Eight Core Industries Update 03 Jun  0 minutes   Macroscope  Macroscope – Indian Industrial Production (IIP) | Index For The Month May 2021 14 Jul  2 minutes   Macroscope  Macroscope – Inflation | CPI Inflation For The Month June 2021 13 Jul  3 minutes   Macroscope  Macroscope – Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) – Services PMI for the month June 2021 05 Jul  3 minutes   Macroscope  Macroscope – Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) – June 2021 02 Jul  3 minutes   Macroscope  Macroscope – CPI Inflation For The Month May 2021 15 Jun  3 minutes   Macroscope  Macroscope – WPI Inflation For The Month May 2021 15 Jun  3 minutes   Macroscope  Macroscope – Indian Industrial Production – Reading Of IIP Index For The Month April 2021 14 Jun  2 minutes   Macroscope  Macroscope – Purchasing Managers’ Index – Services PMI for the month May 2021 10 Jun  3 minutes   Macroscope  Macroscope – RBI Monetary Policy Meet – Policy Update for the month June 2021 04 Jun  3 minutes   Macroscope  Macroscope – Purchasing Managers’ Index – Manufacturing PMI for the month May 2021 01 Jun  3 minutes
