Discussed below are the basic meaning and related details of value investing. What is the meaning of value investing? How is it done?Value investing is a century old investment strategy that was first introduced by Benjamin Graham in the year 1920. This strategy focuses on making higher returns by investing in stocks that are valued lower than their intrinsic value. This implies that the investors have to focus on the fundamentals of the company and firstly calculate the intrinsic value of the stocks.This value is then compared to the current market price of the stocks to determine if they are undervalued or overvalued. If upon comparison, the investors determine the stocks to be undervalued backed by strong fundaments and a good growth trajectory, such stocks are picked under the value investing strategy. The inherent assumption for such an investment strategy is that the price of the stocks is not always in sync with its fundamentals on account of extreme market volatilities. Therefore, investors have to analyze the fundamentals of the company based on various parameters like its P/E Ratio, P/B Ratio, EPS, EBIT, and EBITDA. These parameters allow the investors to assess the financial position of the company as well as determine the future projections ultimately giving a fair idea of its market position. What are the pros and cons of value investing?After learning the basic meaning of value investing, let us understand the pros and cons of this concept. ProsSome of the key advantages of the concept of value investing are mentioned below.Fundamental analysis based investingThis strategy involves the use of various tools and ratios to undertake a thorough fundamental analysis of the stocks or the asset before investment.

The current market price of such stocks is therefore at a lower level than what it actually should be. This allows the investors to accumulate good quality stocks at relatively lower costs which ultimately adds to the returns on the investment in the long term. Time tested strategyThe strategy was first introduced in the year 1920 and is still widely used by most investors across the globe. This is a time-tested strategy and therefore still quite popular despite many new and dynamic strategies available in the modern world.

This may not be ideal for investors that do not have such long time investment horizons or are looking for short-term gains. Risk The risks of investing under this strategy are quite high.
