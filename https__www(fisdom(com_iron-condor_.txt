Traders can buy or sell NIfty options that have a weekly expiry and take an iron condor options strategy on the same. Let us consider the current level of Nifty for this example and create an iron condor at this level 17000.Buy a Put Option at a Nifty level of 16600 (at the premium of Rs 20)Buy a Call Option at a Nifty level of 17400 (at the premium of Rs 20)Sell a Put Option at a Nifty level of 16800 (at the premium of Rs 40)Sell a Call Option at a Nifty level of 17200 (at the premium of Rs 40)In the above case, the net premium received by the trader will be Rs. 40 (40+40-20-20).

For this, the trader needs Nifty to be between 16800 and 17200. If Nifty at the time of expiry is at 17100, then the trader will take the following action.Buy Put Option will expire worthless as it gives the trader the right to sell at 17100 instead of 16600.Buy Call Option will expire worthless since it gives the trader the right to buy at 17400 instead of 17100.Sell Put Option will expire worthless as it gives the trader the right to sell at 16800 instead of 17100.Sell Call Option will expire worthless as it gives the trader the right to buy at 17200 instead of 17100.The net gain in the above situation will be Rs. 2000 (net amount paid as premium)If Nifty is 16600 at the time of expiry, then the trader will take the following action.Buy Put Option will expire worthless as it gives the trader the right to sell at 16600 which is equal to the current Nifty. Buy Call Option will expire worthless since it gives the trader the right to buy at 17400 instead of 16600.Sell Put Option will not expire worthless as it gives the trader the right to sell at 16800 instead of 16600.Sell Call Option will expire worthless as it gives the trader the right to buy at 17200 instead of 16600.In the above case, the trader will incur a net loss of Rs. 160.
