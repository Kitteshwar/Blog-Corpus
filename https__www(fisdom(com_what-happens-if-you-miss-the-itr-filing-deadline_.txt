Some of these consequences are detailed below.  a. Belated return If a taxpayer has missed filing their tax returns on time, they still can file their tax returns in the form of belated returns under section 139(4). This return can be filed any time before the end of the assessment year or before the completion of the assessment, whichever is earlier. Taxpayers are liable to pay interest under section 234A in case of the belated return. However, if the tax liability is nil, they do not need to pay any interest for filing a belated return. b. PenaltyThe prime consequence of not filing the tax return is the penalty. Taxpayers are liable to pay a penalty under section 234F for not filing their tax return on time under section 139(1). The maximum penalty under this section was Rs. 10,000. However, this section was revised for Financial year 20-21. The maximum penalty under this section now stands at Rs. 5,000. The details of the penalty to be paid for non-filing of tax returns are tabled below.Gross Total IncomePenalty Up to Rs. 2,50,000NILUp to Rs. 5,00,000Rs. 1,000Above Rs. 5,00,000Rs. 5,000c. InterestInterest is another crucial factor that has to be considered by the taxpayers when they fail to file their tax returns on time. Taxpayers are liable to pay interest at the rate of 1% per month or part thereof on the tax that is unpaid as per section 234A. An important point to note here is that if the tax liability is more than Rs. 1,00,000, taxpayers will be charged interest from the original due date for their respective category (audit or non-audit cases, transfer pricing, etc, as the case may be) and not the revised due date declared by CBDT. If, however, the tax liability is lower than Rs. 1,00,000, no interest will be charged on ITRs filed before 31st December 2023.d. Delay in receiving refundsRefunds due to the taxpayers are processed and credited to their respective bank accounts only after the due completion of assessment or returns. In order to not delay this process, it is imperative that the returns are filed at the earliest.  e. Set-off and carry forward of losses The Income Tax Act provides the taxpayers a relief against their losses by giving them a benefit to set them off and carry them forward for a period of 8 consecutive years. However, this benefit is available only if the respective ITRs are filed on time i.e., within their due dates. According to the Act, any loss (except loss under income from house property) needs to be reported as well as filed in accordance with provisions of section 139(1) to be eligible for set-off against future gains and carrying the balance forward for 8 years. Conclusion Filing income tax returns is an important part of completing the financial year. However, what is equally important is filing them in time before the completion of the respective due dates. The Income Tax Department has time and again revised the due dates for the benefit and convenience of the taxpayers, especially due to the pandemic.
