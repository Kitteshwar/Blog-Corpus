This document will provide a snapshot of the proposed IPO and can act as a guide for investors in terms of what they can expect. The DRHP will be duly verified to ascertain that the facts stated are correct and investors as well as other stakeholders can submit their feedback on the same too.Once the data is verified and the changes proposed are accepted, the SME IPO will be given in-principle approval to go ahead with the IPO. The IPO will then be launched and open for subscription across the notified category of investors.Once the entire process of IPO is completed and the shares are allotted to the eligible investors, they are then listed on the respective stock exchanges of BSE and NSE. How to apply for SME IPOs?The prerequisites for investors to invest in an IPO are similar to those in the case of regular IPOs.

These shares will then be listed on the SME stock exchanges. Are SME IPOs a good bet?SME IPOs are a good option for startups and other organizations in the SSME category to attract funds for the growth and development of their business. These companies are in the initial growth stage of their business and therefore are riskier. However, when backed by strong financials and a good growth trajectory, they have the potential to provide higher returns for investors.
