Without accurate planning, you might have to alter your lifestyle. In fact, it’s difficult to compromise on your comforts and expenditure. On the other hand, we all wish to have financial freedom when we retire; it gives us the confidence to lead our lives according to our will and not depend on family (children or relatives). As a solution, opting a pension plan would help you to save a good corpus for your old age, thus providing financial security and one such scheme that we help you do so is the “NATIONAL PENSION SYSTEM.”What is NPS?The National Pension System is a Government initiative, intending to provide pension opportunity to every Indian (Resident or Non- Resident) and to inculcate the habit of saving, especially for retirement. It was rolled out on January 2004 for new Government recruits and has been made mandatory for all central government employees and some state government employees. This scheme is not compulsory for Government Employees who have joined before January 2004; however, they can always opt for it if they want to. As for the private sector employees, they have a choice to choose between Employees’ Provident Fund Organization and NPS.Am I eligible for NPS?Any person between the age of 18 – 65 years can open an NPS account, provided you choose the right type:Types of NPS :1.
