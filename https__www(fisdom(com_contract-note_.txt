Therefore, SEBI, the market regulator in India, has implemented various measures to protect the interests of all stock market investors. A contract note contains information like the price, brokerage fees, taxes, etc., in a specific format. This brings transparency for the investors and is therefore one of the steps towards protecting the investor interest.By looking at a contract note in place, an investor can be sure about the execution of the order that he/she may have placed via the broker. This document can also come in handy in case of any legal issues related to a trade. Therefore, investors must insist that their broker provides them with a contract note in a timely manner.ConclusionContract notes act as a summary of trades that an investor has entered on a given trading day. Apart from trade information, this document also allows an investor to get a quick overview of daily profits and losses. Since contract notes are mostly in digital format, these can be easily accessed at any time. FAQsDo all investors receive contract notes?Yes, as per SEBI mandate, all investors can receive contract notes from their brokers if they have bought or sold securities on a stock exchangeCan I get a physical contract note instead of a digital one?Yes, depending on the broker, an investor/trader can request for a physical contract note if not comfortable with a digital option.What if I do not receive my contract note?If you do not receive your contract note despite executing a trade, it could be because you did not provide your email id to the broker or because the trade may not yet be executed.What if a contract note is not digitally signed?If a contract note is in digital format, it has to be digitally signed and the broker ensures this. However, in absence of a digital signature, it will not be considered valid or it may have been physically issued.Are contract notes free or do they come for a fee?Yes, contract notes are provided by all brokers free of cost to the investor/trader, who may have executed trades on a given trading day.Related LinksWhat are futures and options (F&O)? | Difference between F&ONifty Futures – Working, Facts & How to trade it?What are stock futures?- Also Understand Futures PricingOpen Interest and How to use it to Identity Bull/Bear MarketsWhat is Option Trading?
