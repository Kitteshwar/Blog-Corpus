It usually ranges from 300 to 850. A credit score between 700 and 750 is considered good by most lenders. A credit score above 750 is exceptional and preferred by most lenders. Credit scores are calculated and assigned for every individual or business entity that has used any kind of credit. Credit scores are calculated by credit bureaus who get the supporting data from banks and lenders in the country. A credit score provides a glimpse of a borrower’s creditworthiness and is used by all kinds of lenders, such as credit card providers, mortgage lenders, etc. The score may change depending on one’s borrowing activity.How is credit score calculated?A credit score is based on one’s loan repayment track record and history of credit card payments for the past three years.

Those who have a good credit score can also avail higher credit limits, less paper-work, and quick loan processing.A credit score is calculated with the help of the information listed in one’s credit report.

A credit report contains a comprehensive list of all repayment details and lines of credit used. This comprehensive document usually contains details like:Credit scorePersonal information, including name, date of birth, genderIdentification numbers such as PAN, passport numberContact information – address and phone numberIncome detailsAny credit enquiries Public information on bankruptcies, foreclosures, repossessions, judgements on civil suits, etc.A credit report also contains information on loan accounts.

Here are some of the points that help us understand the relationship:The information contained within a credit score and a credit report may be different, however, both serve the same purpose as both act as reliable sources for information and data sets on creditworthiness of the borrower.The credit score is usually a part of a credit report. By looking at both these, a lender can gauge the interest and principal repayment capability of borrowers.Credit rating tells lenders about the probability of recovering the total debt owed, including principal and interest, from the borrower. When banks and lenders receive loan or credit applications from individuals or businesses, without a credit score and a credit report, they may be taking a risk while sanctioning the same. Without credit rating agencies, banks and lenders cannot assess a borrower’s credibility or rely on the independently collected information. Once they have a credit rating and a detailed credit report, lenders can safely take the decision of extending or rejecting a credit request. ConclusionIn a nutshell, a credit report acts as a reflection of one’s borrowing history and the credit score is a summary of the same.
