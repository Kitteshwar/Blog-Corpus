Taxpayers can contribute to PPF and gain interest at the rate of 8.1% per annum (Rate of interest for FY 2021-22), however, the lock-in period of this investment is 15 years. At the same time, employees can also contribute towards VPF (Voluntary Provident Fund) which is a contribution by employees in excess of the mandatory contribution under EPF. Under contribution to VPF, employees can contribute up to 100% of their basic salary and dearness allowance. It is important to note that from FY 21-22, contributions over Rs. 2,50,000 towards VPF will attract tax liability for the employees on the interest earned over such excess contribution. Contribution to NPSNPS is a government-backed scheme that aims to provide an investment in the form of a retirement solution. This scheme allows the investors to get a tax deduction under section 80C up to Rs. 1,50,000. Furthermore, taxpayers can also get an additional discount of Rs. 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B). The scheme provides a tax exemption for 40% of the maturity proceeds while the remaining 60% can also be used in tax savings if they are invested in annuity plans. The process of opening an NPS account is also quite streamlined as well as available online now which helps the taxpayers ensure that they can invest in NPS even as a last-minute tax-saving instrument. Contribution towards health insurance premium under section 80DSection 80D of the Income Tax Act provides deduction towards health insurance premiums up to Rs. 25,000 for taxpayers below the age of 60 and Rs. 50,000 for taxpayers above the age of 60 years. This section also provides for a deduction of Rs. 5,000 for preventive health check-up which is included in the overall lit of 25,000 or 50,000 specified under section 80D as the case may be. Health insurance is one of the prime requirements that is crucial for every person and their family. The process to buy health insurance is quite easy and can be done online by simply approaching a competent health insurance provider. Contribution towards medical treatment of specified diseases and ailmentsApart from providing a deduction for health insurance premiums, the Income Tax Act, also provides a deduction for expenses towards the medical treatment of specified diseases and ailments under section 80DDB. The specified diseases and ailments for this purpose (like AIDS, cancer, thalassemia, etc.) are mentioned by the Department on their website. The deduction under this section is up to Rs. 40,000 for taxpayers till the age of 60 years and Rs. 1,00,000 for seniors and super senior citizens. Deduction for interest paid on education loansThe interest expenses on the payment of education loans for self, spouse, or children can also be claimed as a deduction under the income tax laws in India under section 80E. This helps in reducing the overall cost of education as well as reducing the ultimate tax liability of the taxpayers. Deduction for payment of home loan principal and interestHome loan repayment is often one of the major expenses for any person. The Income Tax Act, therefore, aims to provide relief in the payment of this expenditure in the form of a deduction for the principal as well as interest payment. Taxpayers get a deduction of up to Rs. 1,50,000 under section 80C for the principal component of the home loan EMI as well as the deduction of up to Rs. 2,00,000 towards the interest component of the EMI under section 24 of the Act. This deduction not only allows the taxpayers to reduce their tax liability as well as allows them better financial planning of their expenses.Deduction for investment in tax savings FDsWhile the above deductions are towards the various expenses of the taxpayers, section 80C also includes a deduction for a contribution towards certain investments. One such investment is a contribution towards tax savings bank FDs. These FDs have a minimum lock-in period of 5 years and the rate of interest varies depending on the bank. Banks also provide additional interest rates for senior citizens which can vary depending on the bank guidelines. Deduction for investment in tax saving mutual fundsELSS funds are another important tax savings instrument. Mutual funds have become a staple of every investor today on account of better returns at manageable risks. Certain mutual funds like ELSS funds (Equity Linked Savings Scheme) also allow the investors to claim a deduction of up to Rs. 1,50,000 under section 80C for their investment. The lock-in period of ELSS funds is 3 years but the gains from these funds are taxable in the hands of investors.Investment in any government savings schemeThe government of India has time and again provided many tax savings schemes that aim at public welfare and wealth building for the citizens as well as act as a tax savings instrument. Some of such government savings schemes that can be used as last-minute tax savings instruments are NSC (National Savings Certificate), Senior Citizen Savings Scheme (SCSS), Sukanya Samridhi Scheme, Post Office Time Deposit Schemes, Government Securities or Bonds, etc. Taxpayers can deduction of up to Rs. 1,50,000 under section 80C of the Income Tax Act, 1961ConclusionTax planning and tax savings instruments mentioned above can be used by taxpayers as last-minute tax savings instruments as they can help in reducing their tax liability.
