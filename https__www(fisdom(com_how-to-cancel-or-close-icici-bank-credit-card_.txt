If there are unpaid balances on your card, closure of your card can get delayed. Redemption of Reward PointsBefore you decide to close your card, make sure you redeem all your reward points accumulated on the card. Depending upon your card’s rewards redemption policy, you could either get gifts or vouchers of your choice for the accumulated points. Do not use your card after applying for cancellationOnce you apply for cancellation of your card, you should not use that card. As you use the card, you would accumulate balance on the card, which can delay the card closure.Pay off loans, if anyIf you have availed any loans against your credit card, you should pre-pay them before closing your card. You may have to incur a prepayment penalty on your loan prepayment, depending upon the tenure and the terms and conditions of the loan. Cancel auto-paymentsYou might pay certain bills through your card through standing instructions.

Make sure you pay all charges before you close your card. Any unpaid charges will accumulate and charged interest till you make payment in full.Effect of Credit Card Closure on your Credit ScoreA Credit Score is a measure of your creditworthiness on a scale of 300-900. Credit bureaus issue credit score and is a tool used by lenders to assess if you are worthy of getting a loan/credit card. They calculate your credit score based on your current and past credit behavior. As a credit card is an unsecured (not backed by a security/asset) credit product, anything that you do with your credit card will affect your credit score. Closure of your credit card can also affect your credit score. Let’s learn how.Can reduce your credit historyVery often, you use the same credit card for several years. When used properly, you also end up building an excellent credit history. A long credit history portrays your creditworthiness over time and adds to your credit score. But, when you close a credit card with a long credit history and you have no other products that contribute to your credit history, your credit score can see a temporary drop. May increase your credit utilisation ratioCredit utilisation ratio is an important component of your credit score calculation. Credit Utilisation Ratio is calculated by dividing your credit card billed amount by the credit limit available on your cards. It is good to keep your credit card utilization between 40-50%. When you close a credit card but do not cut down your expenses, then you end up increasing your credit utilisation ratio on other available cards. A high credit utilization ratio is not good for your credit score. Once you get the intimation of the credit card closure from your credit card issuer, proper disposal of the card is also important. You could cut the card into pieces to avoid misuse. How to reactive a canceled ICICI bank credit card?To reactivate a closed or cancelled ICICI Bank credit card, you need to call the toll-free customer service number at 1860 120 7777. The bank will ask you to fulfill various documentation and authentication requirements before issuing the reactivated credit card.Closing a credit card will not have any effect on your future credit card applications. If you have been maintaining a good credit score and are using credit responsibly, then you will not have issues in getting a new credit card when you need one.   Financial Planning  AI tools for personal finance advice- can you rely on them? 22 May  8 minutes   Financial Planning  Portfolio Rebalancing – What is it?
