MarishaBhattWritten by - Marisha BhattApril 6, 2023  10 minutes  The uncertainty of life in this day and age has been a cause of concern for every individual, especially those with family and dependents. In the face of these uncertainties, it is essential that a person secures the financial future of their family. While the loss of life can never be repaired or eased, having financial security will ensure that the dependents are not left to fend for themselves after the demise of their loved ones. Having term insurance or life insurance is therefore not only a good investment option but has become a necessity today to ensure that all the financial obligations of the survivors are taken care of. However, there have been many cases when the claim under the term insurance taken is not given to the intended persons or is exhausted in repaying the existing financial obligations before reaching the rightful survivors to ensure their financial security.

This is under the MWP Act. Given below is a brief discussion of the MWP Act and why it is important for any individual to buy term insurance under this Act.What is the MWP act? In India, women have traditionally faced social, political, and legal challenges in owning and managing their own assets. This has left them vulnerable in property disputes and without financial security for themselves or their children. To address this issue, the Married Women’s Property Act of 1874 was enacted to provide married women with a separate and sole right to their property. This legal safeguard ensures their financial safety and cannot be claimed by anyone else, including their husbands or family members.The MWP Act or the Married Women Property Act, 1874 is a legal provision provided to all married women in the country that protects their right to receive the claim benefits under the term insurance or life insurance plans. Life insurance plans can be taken under Section 6 of this Act. This will ensure that the claim proceeds are free of any financial obligations that are still to be settled (like loans) as well as cannot be claimed by any other person other than the person nominated and eligible to get the claim of the term insurance. A policy under the MWP Act can be taken in the same manner as any other insurance. The only difference is that the policyholder needs to select the option for the same at the time of buying the policy. Once a policy is already taken, it cannot be included under the purview of the MWP Act. This policy can be taken only in the name of the proposer, i.e., the married man who can also be a divorced person or widower. Also Read: Is your health insurance coverage adequate?What does the MWP Act state about term insurance?Section 6 of the Married Women’s Property Act (MWP) was added in 1923 through an amendment to the original Act of 1874. Under Section 6 of the Married Women’s Property Act, 1874, a married man in India has the option to purchase term insurance in his name, which will benefit his wife and/or children in the event of his death. The beneficiaries listed in the policy will receive the sum assured amount without any interference from creditors who may have claims on the policyholder’s outstanding debts.This is not the usual case with term insurance, where creditors may claim the death benefit to cover owed amounts, leaving the policyholder’s family with no financial assistance. Thus, buying insurance under the MWP Act ensures that the death payout is exclusively available to the listed beneficiaries.Here are some of the key features of term insurance under MWP Act:The policy can only be bought to insure the policyholder’s wife and children, and the beneficiaries must be decided at the time of buying the policy.The insurance policy is valid for people of all religions, and Muslim men must take out named policies for their children and wife.Policyholders can divide the policy proceeds among beneficiaries in equal amounts or specific percentages, which must be decided at the time of buying the policy.The policy acts as a trust, and no separate trust is needed for the beneficiaries. A trustee can be assigned to oversee the proceeds, but it is not compulsory. Only the trustees can claim the benefits at the time of the claim, and the policy cannot be claimed by creditors, relatives or included in the policyholder’s will.Who can get the benefits of an insurance policy under the MWP Act? The beneficiaries of the life insurance or the term insurance under the MWP Act are clearly defined. These beneficiaries can only be either of the following,Only the spouse of the insured person  The spouse and the children of the insured personOnly the children of the insured person (this includes both the natural as well as adopted children of the insured person)The policy benefits cannot be claimed by creditors to pay off outstanding debts, as policies under MWP Act are exclusively available to the policyholder’s wife and children.If the policyholder is part of a Hindu Undivided Family (HUF) or a joint family, the policy ensures that the wife and children are protected in case of family property disputes.Insurance policies under MWP Act have a single title, so they cannot be claimed by any relative or guardian acting on behalf of the beneficiaries. The nominated beneficiaries decided at the time of buying the policy are the only recipients of insurance benefits.Also Read: Why investing in term insurance early in life is a good idea?To safeguard the interest of the beneficiaries, the policyholders can appoint trustees that can ensure that the policy is executed effectively. It is not mandatory to appoint a trustee as in the case of beneficiaries as they have to be enlisted at the time of taking the policy. The eligible trustees for this case can be any individual, bank, beneficiary themselves, or any financial institution.What are the pros and cons of buying term insurance under the MWP Act? The MWP Act has been available to the citizens of the country for decades but it is not as popular.
