This means that shares are a portion of the company’s stock that represents the ownership of the shareholder in that company. To understand this concept further, let us take an example where Mr. X holds 10% stock of Company A. The company has issued 1000 shares that make up its entire stock. Therefore, this would imply that Mr. X holds 100 shares of Company A. The provisions of the Companies Act, 2013 provide that a company can convert it’s fully paid-up shares into stock. The ownership of the promoters of the company or other key shareholders can then be represented as a percentage of the stock as highlighted in the above example.What is stock?Now coming to stocks, the literal meaning of this term is a bunch or aggregate of something. To put this in the context of a company’s holdings, stocks are the compilation or the accumulation of the shares of a company. Stocks represent the part ownership of one or more companies held by a person whether an individual or not. While the number of shares issued by a company is finite, there is no limit to the amount of stock held by a person in their portfolio. As mentioned above, it can belong to one or more companies and form part of the person’s portfolio. Let us take the above example again to understand the concept of stocks better. Mr. X holds 100 shares of Company A. the total number of shares issued by the company is 1000 shares. This means that Mr. X. holds 10% stock of the company. Furthermore, if Mr. X also holds 200 shares of Company B where the total number of shares is 4000, he holds 5% stock of Company B. Therefore, ultimately in the portfolio of Mr. X, he has 10% stock of Company A and 5% stock of Company B.What are the basic differences between stock and shares?After understanding the basic meaning of the two terms shares and stocks, let us not consider the basic differences between the two. CategoryStockSharesMeaningShares represent the ownership of the person in a particular company. Stocks represent the ownership or the share of the person in one or more companies. Original issueStocks do not form part of the original issue by any company.

Stocks can be from one or multiple companies hence, for investors, the sky’s the limit when it comes to accumulating stocks. When a company issues shares, they are in a definite quantity. Hence, there is a ceiling on the maximum number of shares of a company that can be held by any person whether (individual or not). Paid-up valueShares can be converted to stocks only when they are fully paid.
