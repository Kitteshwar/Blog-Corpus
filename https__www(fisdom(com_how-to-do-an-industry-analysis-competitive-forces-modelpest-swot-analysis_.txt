In this study, the performance of the company is evaluated in comparison to its industry standards as well as its competition. Industry analysis provides an idea about the market leaders, their business models, the government control or restrictions imposed by them, and demand for the industry or the sector as a whole. This analysis further helps the investors to identify and understand favourable investment opportunities as well as the trajectory of the industry in the short-term and the long-term investment horizon. What are the steps for industry analysis? Industry analysis is part of the overall analysis of the market conditions which helps the investors time their entry and exit from the markets. The steps that can be taken for successful industry analysis are detailed below.Consider available reports There are various research papers and analysis for an industry available today. These materials help the investors have a broad overview of the markets and their key players. The factors like the sensitivity of the industry to the market trends and the macro as well as macroeconomic factors help in determining the volatility of the stocks. Investors can thereby shape their portfolios according to their personal risk-return perceptions. Focus on the core industry Most investors think the words sectors and industry mean the same thing. While it is true that the words are often interchangeable, there is a subtle difference between the two. An industry relates to a particular segment of the trade like the steel industry or the auto industry. The term sector on the other hand has a broader implication and includes all the ancillary industries as well. For example, the transport sector includes the auto industry as well as the auto components industry, and the logistics industry. Therefore, an investor focusing on auto stocks has to focus on the auto industry and does not need to focus on the transport sector as a whole. Hence, the idea for industry analysis is to focus more on the core industry and the factors affecting them and less on the broader parameters. Consider the demand and supply factors for the industry Demand and supply are the basis of the pricing of stocks in any industry. An investor should focus on an industry that commands high and continual demand in the markets. This will ensure the perpetuity of key players and the opportunities for long-term benefits of investing in such stocks. For example, companies like TCS, ITC, and Mahindra Tractors have made a mark for themselves in their respective industries and command a demand for their products not only in our country but also abroad.  Investing in such market leaders helps in building a successful portfolio that can sustain market volatility. The supply of raw materials should also be accounted for. Any uncertainty in the availability of raw materials or disruption in the supply chain will result in a loss of revenue for the companies. Such factors tend to trickle down in market sentiments and ultimately affect the market price of the stocks.Consider the competition Competition in any industry is what ensures best practices and the ultimate benefit for consumers. Having healthy competition also allows the prices of the products to be in check ultimately giving a fair view of the market price of the stocks. While evaluating the competition in industry analysis, it is prudent to evaluate the products offered by the strongest competition and their business practices to analyze where the company can improve. This will help in building a stronger brand value for the company and ultimately prove to be a good bet for the investors. Track the latest developments One of the key factors involved in industry analysis is tracking the latest developments related to the industry. The scope of this factor of analysis is quite broad as it includes tracking the developments within the country and abroad that can have a material impact on the industry as a whole and its key players. Any unfavorable changes in the political scenario or any law that is favourable or unfavorable for the industry can sway the market sentiments in either direction which can either boost one’s portfolio or can potentially wipe it out. Hence, tracking the latest developments that have the potential to even remotely impact the industry has to be thoroughly studied and analyzed to take necessary measures to protect one’s investments. What are the types of industry analysis? The factors that impact or are part of industry analysis also shape the module or the way to conduct industry research. The ways or methods used for industry analysis are highlighted below. Competitive Forces Model This model is also known as Porter’s Five Forces and is one of the most commonly used models for industry analysis. It was introduced by Mr.Michael Porter in his book ‘Competitive Strategy: Techniques for Analyzing Industries and Competitors. This model focuses on 5 key parameters that can affect the market. The details of the same are provided hereunder.Competition with peers The competition within the industry is reviewed to ascertain the demand for various products and the difference between them. The niche created by a product is what generates its demand and when the competition is intense, the variations in the available products are few. This competition also keeps the prices in check for the benefit of ultimate consumers. The potential threat from new entrants The market is always ripe for new entrants and the disruption caused by them. The changing market dynamics due to new entrants further intensify the competition and can change the monopolistic position of the existing players. Bargaining power with the supplier Suppliers in any industry hold the key to the smooth availability of raw materials. If an industry has limited suppliers, they enjoy dominance and higher bargaining power as compared to an industry flooded with suppliers. Bargaining power with the buyer The consumer is the king is the focus in this category. The bargaining power held by buyers is reviewed and where such power is glaring, buyers can influence the prices, and get extra benefits like discounts or better after-sale services, etc. Threat from substitutions The final point of consideration is the threat of substitutions of the company. In the case of an industry having similar or identical products, the customers do not necessarily remain loyal. Any fluctuations in the prices will reflect in its demand and the ability of a company to be top of its game in such a scenario, constantly innovating and analyzing the product for improvement, and being cost-efficient, is what gives them an edge. PEST analysis PEST analysis is the acronym used for the broad areas of analysis in industry research. The parameters under PEST analysis include the analysis ofPolitical scenario in terms of political stability, tax structure, labour laws, ease of doing business, etc.Economic factors like market conditions, inflation, currency rates, fiscal deficit, etc. Social factors like the demography of the target areas, social status, latest fashion trends, etc. Technological factors like the latest technologies that can renew the demand for the product, the latest innovations, and advancement in system updates, etc.SWOT analysis The final type of industry analysis is the SWOT analysis. This is the typical form of analysis undertaken to understand a component on the micro or macro level. Under this analysis the parameters to be reviewed are,Strengths of the industry that give it a competitive edge Weaknesses of the industry that make it vulnerable and open to potential losses.Opportunities in the industry that can help in improving the bottom line and the overall performance of the company or the industry as a whole. Threats in the industry are the dangers that can adversely impact the industry or any particular business belonging to the same. Conclusion Industry analysis is one of the first steps in building an investment portfolio. Whether on the micro level or macroeconomic level, having a strong company or an industry is not enough. The ability to be relevant and to transform based on changing economic conditions is essential for an industry to survive and grow. Industry analysis helps in understanding the relevant opportunities that can be converted to concrete solutions and ultimately benefit the consumers and other stakeholders. FAQsWhat are the key areas of evaluation in industry analysis?The key areas of analysis under industry analysis are selecting an industry that is familiar, the business model, the valuation of the company, the management of the company, and the growth trajectory of the product at hand against the competitors.What are the biggest contributors to determining the prices of products and services in an industry?The core factors like demand and supply in the industry along with factors like price cap by the government, etc. contribute to determining the overall prices in the industry.Who introduced Porter’s Five Forces model for industry analysis?Porter’s Five Forces model for industry analysis was introduced by Mr. Michael Porter.Can industry analysis be helpful for an average investor?Yes, it is advisable to have a basic industry analysis while curating a portfolio to understand the industry sensitivity to market fluctuations which can help ascertain the optimum entry and exit points.
