Apart from the postal services, post offices are also known for the various investment products offered by them. These investment products were developed keeping in mind the rural population and to boost the habit of savings and investment in them. As most banks even today do not have adequate reach in the remotest parts of the country, post office investment schemes can provide good investment options at a relatively low cost. One such scheme is the 5 year Post Office Recurring Deposit Scheme, popularly known as the PORD (or National Savings Recurring Deposit). Read on to know more about the Post Office Recurring Deposit Scheme/National Savings Recurring Deposit.PORD is a Government-backed systematic savings plan with a fixed interest rate.This scheme provides guaranteed returns that help investors to save equal and sizeable sums of money over 5 years.The account can be opened with a minimum investment sum of Rs. 10 and has no upper limits. You can also close this account prematurely but will be subjected to penalties.Investment GoalThis scheme was launched by the Indian Government with the objective to provide a risk-free scheme to conservative investors. The scheme can provide guaranteed returns on monthly deposits that are made over 60 months at a higher interest rate than traditional banks.HighlightsRiskDeposits made by the investor under the PORD scheme are government-backed deposits and hence are completely secure. The returns are not subject to any fluctuation unlike mutual fund markets making them ideal for risk-averse investors.ReturnsThe returns on PORD are in the form of fixed interest received on the deposits made every month continuously for 5 years. The current interest rate for PORD is 5.8% which is higher than the average bank rate for recurring deposits (starting from 2.75% or 3% depending on the bank). The interest on PORD is compounded quarterly and paid on an annual basis to the investors or depositors.TaxationThe contributions made to a PORD account are eligible for a tax deduction under section 80C of the Income Tax Act, 1961. The maximum deduction under this section is Rs. 1,50,000. The interest earned on the PORD is taxable under the head “income from other sources’ . The amount of interest is added to the taxable income of the depositor and taxed at the applicable slab rates. The interest income over Rs. 40,000 (No TDS for senior citizens) is subject to a TDS at the rate of 10% for depositors having an active and valid PAN. In other cases, the depositor not having a valid PAN will be charged TDS at 20%. Lock-in LimitationsThe deposits made under PORD are subject to a minimum lock-in period of 5 years. Depositors have the opinion to extend their deposits under PORD for a further period of 5 years making the total deposit tenure of 10 years maximum.WithdrawalsThe scheme allows the depositors to withdraw from the scheme only after the completion of 1 year from the time of making the initial deposit. At this time, the depositors are allowed to withdraw 50% of the balance in the fund. The depositors are required to repay the amount withdrawn along with the simple interest applicable to them.Capital ProtectionPORD is part of the Post Office Savings Schemes. These schemes are Government-backed schemes to promote the habit of savings and investment among the rural population, especially providing them with better investment options. Hence, the capital under this scheme is completely secure without any risk of loss or becoming NIL due to market fluctuations, unlike mutual fund investments.Inflation ProtectionLike most Government-backed schemes, PORD also provides no protection against inflation. When inflation is above interest, the account earns no real returns.OverviewFeature DescriptionEligibility Any resident Indian Entry ageFor adults – Above 18 years For children – Minors above the age of 10 yearsFee Structure (Account Opening Fee & Maintenance Charges)The minimum investment is Rs. 100 (continued with multiples of Rs. 10)No maximum limit of investment.Interest 5.8%per annum.Exit option / Liquidation of policyAllowed after 3 years.
