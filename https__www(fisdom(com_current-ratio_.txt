A company must ideally have sufficient assets to repay its debt without requiring fresh capital or diluting its shareholding.The name of this ratio is so because it estimates only a company’s present assets and liabilities, unlike other liquidity ratios. Current assets are those assets that can be easily liquidated and converted into cash within a short duration, approximately one year. Current assets may include:CashMoney market instrumentsAccounts receivables (from vendors or customers)Mutual fund investmentsInventory Prepaid expenses Current liabilities include short-term debt or short-term loans payable.

Here are some basic guidelines on current ratio interpretation:Current ratio > 1 is considered goodThis means that the company’s current assets are more than its current liabilities. Therefore, it will have strong cash flows and may pose minimum credit risk.Current Ratio < 1 is considered a red flag for investorsThis is when a company’s current assets are less as compared to its current liabilities. Such companies may need to raise additional funds or liquidate long-term assets for paying off loans. These companies tend to carry higher credit risk.Current Ratio = 1When a company’s assets and liabilities are the same, its current ratio will be 1. This indicates that the company has only as many assets as can repay its loans. With a small decrease in its cash flow, the company may easily face credit defaults.Therefore, investors tend to prefer companies with a current ratio that is more than one. Generally, the higher the current ratio, the better position it is considered to be in. However, a current ratio beyond three could mean that the company has an abundance of cash and it is not being used productively. An ideal current ratio is something between one and three.Why is the current ratio important?Current ratio is considered by creditors while evaluating a company’s credit status before offering short-term debts. This ratio also gives insight into a company’s operating cycle. It reflects a company’s ability to liquidate its assets for paying off its short-term liabilities.What are the limitations of the current ratio?Here are some of the limitations of current ratio that should be considered before using it for company evaluation:The ratio only talks about the quantity of assets and not necessarily the quality of assets held by a company.It is possible to manipulate a current ratio through overvaluation of current assets.Current ratio does not tell whether a company is receiving timely payments from customers. For instance, a company may have a high current ratio but its customers could be delaying payments. Many companies may neglect several liabilities to present a good current ratio. ConclusionWhile the current ratio is important for analyzing a company’s financial health, it is not the only determining factor that investors should consider. A company that has a current ratio of 2 or more may not necessarily be worth investing in. Investors should bear in mind that a current ratio does not always represent a company’s liquidity or solvency. There are various other factors that equally determine a company’s financial health. In the end, it is important to keep in mind that no one financial parameter defines a company’s investment worth. To gauge a company’s full potential, investors and stakeholders must look at all possible factors and from all angles.FAQsWhat does the quick ratio tell us?The quick ratio is a measurement of a company’s capacity to pay towards its current liabilities without selling its inventory or obtaining additional financing.
