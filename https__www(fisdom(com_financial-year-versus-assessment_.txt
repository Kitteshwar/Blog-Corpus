At the end of the financial year, individuals and businesses calculate their net income as per the provisions of the Income Tax Act 1961 and pay taxes on such income at the applicable tax rates.

For example, if the financial year 2022-23 runs from 01 Apr 2022 and ends on 31st March 2023, the assessment year will run from 01 Apr 2023 to 31 March 2024. For a taxpayer in India, it’s important to understand the assessment year as it determines the tax liability for the previous financial year.

Once the tax return is filed, the Income Tax Department may issue a notice to the taxpayer for further assessment or clarification. The taxpayer must respond to the notice and provide any necessary documents or information.
