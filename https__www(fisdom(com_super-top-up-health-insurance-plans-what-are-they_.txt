This plan helps in covering the total hospital bills up to a specified limit under the super to-up plan and over the deductible amount. The basic difference between a simple top-up plan and a super top-up plan is that the latter is used for claims relating to the annual medical expenses of the insured person and their family rather than on a per claim basis. The super top-up plan is activated once the threshold of the original health insurance plan is exhausted. The advantage of super top-up plans is that it considers the aggregate of the total hospitalization bills in a  year to calculate the amount payable over and above the deductible. Hence, if a person is prone to hospitalization or needs cover for chronic ailments or diseases, they can opt for a super top-up health plan.

However, such cover is often inadequate, and therefore, employees need to take a super top-up plan for excess health insurance cover. Increase an insufficient health coverageThe medical costs in the country are on a constant rise. This often makes the existing health coverage insufficient. Therefore, it gives rise to the need for additional coverage which can be easily available through a super top-up plan at a nominal excess premium.Excess coverage for senior citizensHealth insurance for senior citizens is especially costly.
