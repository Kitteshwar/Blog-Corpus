Therefore, AMFI has issued specific registration numbers also known as ARN (AMFI Registration Number). The ARN is issued after the eligible party has cleared the necessary eligibility criteria and is credible to carry out the designated functions without any chances of potential damage to the investors’ interests. AMFI specifies that a person eligible for getting ARN has to be a minimum of 18 years old and also get the necessary clearance from NISM (Nationalism Institute of Securities Market). The conditions of AMFI also specify that senior citizens wanting to get ARN have to clear the required CPE (Continuing Professional Education) to get up to date with the latest norms and conditions as per AMFI requirements. The AMFI ARN is the license issued by the AMFI to sell mutual fund units.
