The growth option provides returns in the form of an increase in value of mutual fund units. The dividend option, on the other hand, offers returns through periodic dividends. Investors often get confused between the two and wonder whether a growth fund is better than dividend plans. It is important to note that one option is not necessarily better than the other. Investors should choose an option that is more suited to specific investment needs, financial objectives and tax benefits.   Table of Contents  hide   1 What is a dividend plan in mutual funds?   2 Who can buy dividend mutual funds?   3 How to buy a dividend plan?   4 Are dividend mutual fund plans worth investing in?   5 Factors to consider while buying dividend plans   6 Conclusion   7 FAQs   8 You may also like..

The most common pay-out interval for dividend plans is yearly. Some mutual fund schemes may also offer pay-out intervals such as daily, monthly, quarterly, etc. Some schemes may also offer multiple pay-outs. One of the types of dividend option within mutual fund schemes is dividend reinvestment option. Under this, the dividends paid to investors are reinvested in the mutual fund scheme. Here are some important features of dividend plan:As per SEBI regulations, dividends must be paid to investors from the accumulated profits of the mutual fund scheme.Mutual fund schemes give no assurance on dividend pay-out rate or timing of pay-outs.The dividend paid to investors is adjusted from the NAV of the scheme.

Thus, in these plans, an investor ends up getting back his/her own investment in the form of a dividend. Effective from FY21, the dividend distributed by mutual funds is taxable at income tax slab rates which may result in payment of tax on an investor’s capital.Here’s an example to better understand the tax treatment of dividends in mutual funds. A mutual fund was launched at a net asset value (NAV) of Rs. 10 and it appreciated to Rs. 15. An investor invests in the fund at Rs. 15 and its value further increases to Rs. 17. At this time the fund books its profits and declares a dividend of Rs. 7, due to which the NAV of the fund comes back to Rs. 10. The investor gets back the profit on initial investment (Rs. 2) and also Rs. 5 which is his own capital. The total dividend amount (Rs. 7) is taxable at the income tax slab rate of the investor (which can also be 30%) even though the real profit made by the investor is only Rs. 2. Thus, dividend plans may not be as beneficial to investors as growth funds. Factors to consider while buying dividend plansSome of the important factors to note while buying dividend mutual fund schemes are:A high dividend payout may be an indication that the company may be out of growth opportunitiesInvestors should not expect dividend-yielding mutual funds to continue paying a fixed amount in fixed timelinesTotal returns offered by dividend options could be lower as compared to growth options in the long term. This is primarily due to periodic payouts.ConclusionInvestors who have a low-risk appetite and want to earn higher returns in the short term can choose to invest in dividend mutual funds. Before planning an investment in dividend funds, investors must make sure to study the fund’s consistency of dividend payout and historical performance.FAQsAre mutual fund dividends the same as stock dividends?Mutual fund dividends are different from stock dividends.
