A mutual fund was launched at a net asset value (NAV) of Rs. 10 and it appreciated to Rs. 15. An investor invests in the fund at Rs. 15 and its value further increases to Rs. 17. At this time the fund books its profits and declares a dividend of Rs. 7, due to which the NAV of the fund comes back to Rs. 10. The investor gets back the profit on initial investment (Rs. 2) and also Rs. 5 which is his own capital. The total dividend amount (Rs. 7) is taxable at the income tax slab rate of the investor (which can also be 30%) even though the real profit made by the investor is only Rs. 2. Thus, dividend plans may not be as beneficial to investors as growth funds. Factors to consider while buying dividend plansSome of the important factors to note while buying dividend mutual fund schemes are:A high dividend payout may be an indication that the company may be out of growth opportunitiesInvestors should not expect dividend-yielding mutual funds to continue paying a fixed amount in fixed timelinesTotal returns offered by dividend options could be lower as compared to growth options in the long term.
