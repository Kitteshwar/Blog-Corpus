Discussed below is the basic meaning of long-term investing and the ideal mutual fund categories for the same. What is long-term investing?The concept of long-term investing is not new in the country. With many traditional investment options like Bank FDs, PPFs, etc., we are used to waiting a few years to get good returns. Under mutual funds too, there are many investment categories that focus on long-term investment horizons to ensure maximum wealth creation for investors. The usual investment horizon under long-term investing is approximately 5 years to 7 years and above. However, the idea of a long-term investment horizon is relative to the type of investor. If the investor is aggressive in nature, an investment horizon of 3 years or more can be long-term for such inverse while for a conservative investor, a long-term investment horizon could also mean 5 years to 10 years or more. For long-term investing, the most preferred choice of investment is equity funds. Equity funds are funds that invest predominantly in equity and equity-related instruments (minimum of 65% of the fund). These funds although highly volatile, provide the maximum opportunity of achieving higher returns and are ideal for aggressive investors with a higher risk appetite.What are the advantages of long-term investing?Some of the key advantages of long-term investing are highlighted below. Increased benefit of compoundingMutual funds are a dynamic investment option and one of its key features is the benefit of compounding which increases the returns for the investors as compared to many other traditional investment options. This benefit is further enhanced with the increase in the duration of investment as the returns get more years to be multiplied.Relatively less prone to market volatilityEquity funds are highly volatile and react the most to market fluctuations. However, it is always observed that the markets may face a slump in the short-term, in the long-term, the equity markets have always increased and provided better returns than other funds like debt funds. Therefore, having funds with a long-term investment horizon reduces the risk of market volatility while at the same time providing higher returns.  Effective financial planningInvesting in long-term funds, allows the investors to get maximum time to build their corpus. Therefore investing in long-term investments is ideal for financial planning or meeting the long-term goals like retirement, children’s higher education, wedding expenses, etc. Gradually building their corpus over a long-term investment horizon will not even put a financial burden on them of meeting the expenses in one shot or at a short notice. Lower effective cost of investmentOne of the main features of investing in mutual funds is investing through SIPs. This allows the investors to invest smaller amounts consistently over the investment horizon of the fund. This benefit of gradually adding to the investment not only increases the benefit of compounding but also reduces the rupee cost of investment in the long term. This reduction in costs is further translated into higher net returns which further help in wealth creation.  What are the most preferred categories for long-term investing?The most commonly preferred mutual fund categories for long-term investing are mentioned below.Large-cap FundsLarge-cap funds are the funds that invest heavily in stocks of large-cap companies (minimum 80% of the fund). Large-cap companies for this context are the companies that rank between 1 to 100 in terms of market capitalization on the recognized stock exchange. These companies are also known as blue-chip companies and are market leaders in their segments or industries. Investors of these funds usually have the buy and hold strategy and look for opportunities where they can buy their target stock from this category at lower rates. This will help them reduce their overall cost of investment thus adding to their returns. Mid-cap FundsMid-cap funds are funds that invest in stocks of mid-cap companies (minimum of 65% of the fund). These companies rank between 101 to 250 in terms of market capitalization on any stock exchange. These companies are emerging market leaders that have a good product or a sound business plan and the potential to generate higher returns than large-cap companies. The risk of the fund however is also higher than that of the large-cap funds. The usual investment horizon of these funds is approximately 5 years and more which allows the fund to generate decent returns for the investors and help them in achieving their goals. Small-cap FundsSmall-cap funds are funds that invest primarily in stocks of small-cap companies (minimum 65% of the fund). These companies rank 251 and above in terms of market capitalization on a stock exchange. The funds are considered to have the highest risk as compared to mid-cap and large-cap funds along with the potential to provide the maximum returns. Liquidity is often seen as an issue in these funds but an investment horizon of a minimum of more than 10 years allows the investors to gain the maximum advantage of their investment as well as avoid short-term liquidity issues. Flexi-cap FundsFlexi-cap funds belong to the dynamic group of mutual funds where there are no set guidelines of minimum investment ratio as per SEBI. these funds unlike multi-cap funds can invest in any ratio among the large-cap, mid-cap, and small-cap companies based on their investment strategy and market trends. This allows the fund manager to apply their expertise and choose equities that meet the objective of providing a maximum advantage to the investors while at the same time managing the overall risks and contributing to the wealth creation objective of the funds. These are high-risk funds suitable for aggressive investors having a minimum investment horizon of 5 years and more.Top funds for long term investingAfter learning about the various categories of funds, let us now have an overview of the top mutual funds with the long-term investment horizon. Axis Bluechip FundThis fund belongs to the large-cap category of funds and invests in equity and equity-related instruments of large-cap companies.
