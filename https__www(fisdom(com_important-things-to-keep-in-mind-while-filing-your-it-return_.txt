To aid the easy filing of IT returns, here we will share some important aspects to remember.1. Maintain relevant documentationDocuments such as Form 16, proof of investment for deductions, rent receipts, TDS data, home loan interest certificates, etc. must be maintained safely while filing tax returns. It is also important to retain documentary evidence of IT returns filing for future reference. Many assessees tend to dispose of such documents once the IT return filing process is complete. All these are crucial documents that the IT department may request for reference in the future.2. Ensure accurate disclosure of incomeITR filing process requires assessees to disclose all of their income sources and also accurate income from each source, irrespective of whether it is taxable or exempt. Many people miss out on disclosing smaller incomes, assuming they may not be required. This can attract notice from the IT department. Therefore, to ensure the appropriate filing of IT returns, one must include all types of income and disclose even such income that may be exempt from tax.3. File ITR within due dateMost tax experts suggest filing IT returns on time. Waiting until the due date could result in errors, the possibility of technical issues with the online portal, etc. Also, filing IT returns after the due date attracts a penalty in the form of late fees. In some cases, this could also result in disallowance of deduction or losses being carried forward. 4. Select the right ITR formOne of the most crucial steps in ITR filing is selecting the appropriate ITR form. In all, there are 7 different ITR forms made available by the tax authorities. An assessee must choose one of these based on certain criteria like the nature of income, category of the assessee, losses being carried forward, etc. The table below shows the list of ITR forms and applicability.ITR FormsAssessee typeITR 1, 2 & 3Individual & HUFsITR 4Individual, HUFs and partnership companiesITR 5Partnership companies, BOI, AOP, LLP, local authority etc.ITR 6Companies except those claiming exemption under section 11ITR 7Charitable trusts, business trust, political parties, or companies claiming exemption under section 11, etc.5. Mandatory ITR filing for those with no tax duesMany taxpayers assume that they need not file IT returns if they do not have any tax dues in a financial year. However, the fact is that ITR must be filed even if one does not owe any taxes in a financial year. Deductions and exemptions can be claimed by an assessee only if he/she files IT returns.Watch this video on YouTube6. Verification of credits in Form 26ASSince ITRs are now linked to Form 26AS, one can access pre-filled information pertaining to Form 26AS in the ITRs. However, it is advisable to check the information in Form 26AS against the ITRs to be on the safer side. Assesses must carefully verify the credits as per Form 26AS to ensure error-free filing of Income tax returns.Did you knowForm 26AS is a consolidated statement that shows details of annual TDS or tax deducted at source, TCS or tax collected at source, self-assessment tax and any advance tax paid by the assessee. 7. Proof of deductions claimedAssessees must also make sure to claim all the applicable deductions. Whether it is towards expenses incurred or investments made, one must keep track of all these items throughout the year to claim deductions. By double-checking all the information filled in the IT returns, one can ensure an overall smooth process.ConclusionThe entire process of Income-tax filing can be a nightmare for many. However, apart from penalty and interest charges, there can also be other long-term consequences of not filing IT returns or delay in submission.
