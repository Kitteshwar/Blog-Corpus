To aid the easy filing of IT returns, here we will share some important aspects to remember.1. Maintain relevant documentationDocuments such as Form 16, proof of investment for deductions, rent receipts, TDS data, home loan interest certificates, etc. must be maintained safely while filing tax returns. It is also important to retain documentary evidence of IT returns filing for future reference. Many assessees tend to dispose of such documents once the IT return filing process is complete. All these are crucial documents that the IT department may request for reference in the future.2. Ensure accurate disclosure of incomeITR filing process requires assessees to disclose all of their income sources and also accurate income from each source, irrespective of whether it is taxable or exempt. Many people miss out on disclosing smaller incomes, assuming they may not be required. This can attract notice from the IT department. Therefore, to ensure the appropriate filing of IT returns, one must include all types of income and disclose even such income that may be exempt from tax.3. File ITR within due dateMost tax experts suggest filing IT returns on time. Waiting until the due date could result in errors, the possibility of technical issues with the online portal, etc. Also, filing IT returns after the due date attracts a penalty in the form of late fees. In some cases, this could also result in disallowance of deduction or losses being carried forward. 4. Select the right ITR formOne of the most crucial steps in ITR filing is selecting the appropriate ITR form. In all, there are 7 different ITR forms made available by the tax authorities.
