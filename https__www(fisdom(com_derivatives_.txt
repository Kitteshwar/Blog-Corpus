Derivative markets can include many types of assets like currency, commodities, exchange rates, indices, etc. The investor earns returns on these assets through the speculation of the future performance of an underlying asset. Derivatives can be broadly classified into two types of market namely, exchange-traded derivatives and over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives. The former includes contracts that are regulated and managed by the market and have standardized contracts with a comparatively lower risk of default. OTC derivatives on the other hand are unregulated non-standardized contracts that do not have any intermediaries or any exchange to be traded on. These are flexible contracts that can be easily modified and hence carry huge risks. Who are the participants of the derivatives market?Derivative markets consist of four major participants. Given below are a few details of the same.1.HedgersHedgers are the investors that invest in the derivatives market to eliminate the risk of any change in the future prices of the asset. The primary intention is to secure the existing exposure in the market or to reduce the risk and not to earn profits.2.SpeculatorsSpeculators are traders who predict the prices of an asset or derivative based on the future movement of the underlying asset and take calculated risks to earn profits. It is the most common market activity. 3.Margin tradersMargin is the nominal percentage of the value of the investment to be deposited by the investor to cover the risk of the investment. Margin traders use this margin money to purchase more stocks.4.ArbitrageursArbitrage is the activity of earning profit based on the difference in prices of an asset in two different markets. Arbitrageurs purchase an asset at a lower price in one market and sell it in another market at a higher price to gain profits.What are the different types of derivative contracts?The derivative market is essentially divided into four types of market instruments. These instruments are explained below.1.FuturesThese are standard agreements or a contract between two parties that are executed on the exchange market. Under this contract, the buyer or the holder of the contract has the right as well as an obligation to buy or sell an underlying asset at the agreed future prices. 2.OptionsLike futures contracts, options also provide the right but not an obligation to buy or sell an underlying asset at a future price. There are many types of options like American, European, etc which can be bought using call (option to buy) or put (option to sell) options  3.ForwardsForward contracts are similar to futures contracts with the only difference being that they are over-the-counter contracts and hence are not traded on any recognized exchange. The parties in the contract can customize the contract based on their needs and risk-return parameters. 3.SwapsSwaps are another type of over-the-counter instrument where the parties are allowed to swap or exchange their obligations. The most common type of swaps is the interest rate swaps along with currency swaps or commodity swaps, etc. What are the advantages of the derivatives market?Derivative markets, although riskier than primary markets, have many advantages. Some of these advantages are discussed below. 1.Reduced capital investmentDerivatives and an excellent option to invest in stock markets with limited capital. Investors can get attractive returns from lower capital investment as compared to primary investment instruments like shares and mutual funds.  2.Reduced cost of investment The cost of investment in derivative markets is lower than the cost of investment in primary assets like shares and debentures. The reduced capital investment further decreases the cost of investment for the investors. 3.Effective risk management techniqueDerivative markets are an effective tool to reduce the risk of investment. The participants of the derivative market can hedge their risks and also gain the benefit of arbitrage along the way. This increases the potential returns for the participants of derivatives markets.4.Flexibility to trade in Exchange traded contracts or OTC contracts Another benefit of the derivatives market is the flexibility to trade in standard or nonstandard contracts. Participants can customise the contract to suit their needs and gain maximum returns at calculated risks.What are the disadvantages of the derivatives market?After discussing the above advantages of derivatives markets, let us now discuss their limitations. 1.RisksThe first and foremost limitation of the derivatives market is the risk. These markets carry significantly more risk than primary markets. If the risk is not effectively managed, it can result in huge losses for the participants.2.Complexity The contracts in derivatives markets are quite complex and need thorough market knowledge before participation. A novice person may end up losing more money than making some if they do not understand the functionality of these markets and the contracts entered by them.  3.SpeculationSpeculation is the key to these markets to maximize the returns. The unpredictability of these markets and the higher risks may lead to higher losses and can potentially drain all the capital investment of the investors.Difference between cash market and derivative marketCash markets are the markets that trade-in cash for commodities or assets and receive them at the point of sale.

Investors have to ensure that their broker allows derivative trading and opens an account for the same. The trade can be executed through a call or online. Investors have to also select the asset class and the lot sizes prudently based on their margin capabilities and other factors like risk return parameters.Investors have the option to hold their positions till the last day of the contract to ensure that they get maximum returns on the same.Conclusion Derivatives are an attractive investment option for many traders with a high-risk appetite. It allows them to hedge their risk and gain the benefits of arbitrage. However, it is a high-risk game and the investors who do not take calculated risks or over-expose themselves can end up in the deep end and lose all their capital along the way. Hence it is advisable to have a good knowledge of these markets before plunging into them.FAQs1. Can a person take multiple positions to hedge their risks?A. Yes.
