EPF is Employee’s Provident Fund whereas EPS is Employee’s Pension Scheme. Both these are unique saving schemes offered by the Government of India to salaried citizens of the country. These schemes primarily gather a corpus by setting aside a portion of an employee’s basic salary and dearness allowance. EPF requires contributions to be made by both the employer and employee whereas EPS only requires contributions from the employer.   Table of Contents  hide   1 What is EPF?   2 What is EPS?   3 Commonalities between EPF and EPS   4 Conclusion   5 FAQs Read on to find out more about EPF and EPS and what factors differentiate these two schemes.What is EPF?EPF is a retirement scheme that promotes savings among salaried individuals for a financially secure retirement. Under this scheme, both the employee and employer must contribute the same amount every month to the employee’s provident fund account. The employer and the employee’s contribution to EPF have to be 12% of the employee’s salary each (calculated on basic salary plus dearness allowance).A retirement corpus is accumulated through this until the individual reaches the end of his/her working period. Upon retiring, the employee can withdraw the net amount along with interest earned on the same.EPF offers regular interest on the corpus accumulated in the EPF account. For the financial year 2021-22, the interest rate applicable on EPF is 8.1%. Suggested link: Use EPF calculator to check interest earned on your EPF investmentWhat is EPS?Under this pension scheme, salaried individuals can earn a pension provided they are members of the EPFO or Employees Provident Fund Organisation and their employers have made periodic contributions to their EPS account. Employers contribute 8.33% of the employee’s salary (basic + dearness allowance) to the EPS account. Employees are not required to contribute under this scheme.In this scheme, the employee starts receiving a pension after attaining 58 years of age.
