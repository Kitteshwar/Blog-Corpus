This reduces the burden of the taxpayers and allows them to focus solely on their profession. Ease of tax filing The tax filing process for presumptive taxation becomes quite simple as against a regular tax filing. This is on account of reduced compliance procedures to be followed and the documentation needed is negligible. Reduced tax liabilityProfessionals do not usually have higher capital expenditure or high regular expenses to meet their professional requirements. Despite this, section 44ADA provides the option to tax only 50% of their gross receipts which can substantially reduce their tax burden.Option to move in and out of the scheme without the restriction of 5 yearsProfessionals can opt in and out of this scheme at any point without any lock-in or restrictions of 5 years unlike provisions of section 44AD applicable on business.Things to consider before opting for Section 44ADAHere are some of the aspects to bear in mind before using provisions of Section 44ADA:Actual expenditure: Professionals with a low net profit ratio should avoid this tax provision.No deduction for remuneration paid to partners: There is no provision in the tax act that allows professionals to deduct remuneration paid to partners from presumptive income.Partner’s option: Even if a professional firm does not adopt this tax provision, its partners can still opt for Section 44ADA in terms of interest or salary received for the same firm.Option to opt-out: Professionals who had previously chosen this tax provision can opt out of it at any time, unlike some specific types of taxpayers.After carefully weighing all these factors, one can decide whether to opt for and make the most of Section 44ADA for tax-saving purposes.ConclusionThere are many sections pertaining to presumptive taxation under the Income Tax Act.
