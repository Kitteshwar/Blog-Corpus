Here are some details on the same:Salaried IndividualsFor salaried employees, contribution to Employees Provident Fund (EPF) becomes a part of yearly investment towards a fixed income product. For those looking to balance out the risk & returns in their portfolio, ELSS investment can be a good option.Apart from the possibility of higher returns, investments in ELSS also provide the benefit of tax deduction under section 80C. Although Unit Linked Insurance Plans (ULIPs) and the National Pension Scheme (NPS) also provide similar benefits, the setback is a higher lock-in period & lower scope of returns.ULIPs come with a lock-in period of five years, and NPS is considered an investment option for retirement since the invested amount is locked until the investor turns 60 years of age. Among all these, ELSS investment comes with the shortest lock-in period of three years.New InvestorsFor new investors who want to gain experience of equity investing through mutual funds along with tax benefits, ELSS can prove to be an ideal choice. Although equity investments come with substantial risk, it is generally in short term due to market fluctuations. If one remains invested for more than five years, the risk can be relatively lesser. New investors can begin ELSS exposure through monthly SIPs spread across the year. ELSS investment through SIP can help in accumulating more units when the market performance is in a downswing and may generate better returns as the market performance turns favourable. ELSS can come across as an excellent way of building wealth for a young investor as he/she can take some risks as the time is their side.How to invest in ELSS Funds?To invest in ELSS funds, investors can easily download and install the Fisdom  app and follow the below steps:Navigate to the ELSS mutual funds section on the app and go through the list of available optionsStudy the historical returns of the available options and select an option to investClick on Invest against the ELSS fund nameSelect SIP or lump-sum option and enter the amount to be investedContinue towards paymentEnter the bank and personal details to complete the investment process.How to redeem ELSS Units?In ELSS, every SIP instalment has to complete the mandatory 3-year lock-in period. Thus, if an investor invests in ELSS via SIP, after completion of 36 months he/she can only redeem the units allotted through the first SIP instalment. Subsequent units can be redeemed when they complete the three year lock-in period.Although investors can redeem their proportion units after completion of three-year lock-in period, it is not mandatory to do so. Once the lock-in period ends, the fund turns into a diversified, open-ended equity-oriented scheme. Therefore, investors can choose to redeem the units as per their requirement.It is important to note that the lock-in period is applicable on the date of purchase of the fund units or the SIP date. Let’s understand this with the help of an example:SIP DateUnitsLast Date of Lock-In Period 01 April 202110001 April 202401 May 20219501 May 202401 Jun 20219901 Jun 202401 Jul 202111001 Jul 2024As per the above example, SIP units purchased on 1st April 2021 can be redeemed after 1st April 2024.
