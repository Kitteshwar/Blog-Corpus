What are ELSS Mutual Funds?ELSS mutual funds have an asset allocation strategy that focuses primarily on equities. The portfolio of these schemes comprises 65% equity and equity-linked securities ( For ex-listed shares) and the remaining is allocated to fixed-income securities in some cases. These funds generally have a lock-in period of three years. Through investment in ELSS mutual funds, investors can get a dual benefit of tax deductions combined with wealth creation over time.What are the important features of ELSS funds?Some of the important features of ELSS are:ELSS portfolio mostly comprises equities and limited exposure to fixed-income securitiesELSS investment can offer dual benefits of tax deductions and wealth creationELSS funds are a tax-saving investment option that also has the potential to offer inflation-beating returnsELSS funds have a lock-in period of three years, and most funds do not allow investors to make an early exit. Even during a downturn in the market, investors cannot redeem their investment in ELSS. This prevents any panic-related outflows and helps to increase the chances of capital appreciation.There is no upper limit on the amount that can be invested in ELSS. The minimum investable amount could vary across fund houses.Through ELSS investment, investors can avail tax deductions of up to Rs 1,50,000 a year as per the provisions of Section 80C of the Income Tax ActWith SIP investment in ELSS mutual funds, investors can ensure a disciplined investment and benefit from the rupee cost averaging that can nullify stock market volatility to an extent.ELSS mutual funds can generate better returns as compared to investments such as NSC, PPF, VPF, etc. However, since ELSS investments are market-linked, there is no guarantee of returns.What is the tax treatment of ELSS investments?Investors must learn about the tax treatment of ELSS investments before making an investment decision. Here are some of the important points to note:Capital gains from ELSS have the same tax treatment as gains from any Equity Instruments. Short term capital gains (STCG) attract a tax of 15%Long Term Capital gains (LTCG) are taxable if the gains exceed Rs. 1 lakh during a financial year. LTCG is taxed at 10% on the amount exceeding Rs. 1 lakh (the limit of 1lakh is inclusive of all equity investments) From the FY 2020-21, dividends received by investors are taxable at 10% when in excess of Rs 5000 from any mutual fund.ELSS Funds Compared to Other Tax-Saving Options:For Investors who are considering long-term tax-saving investments, here is a comparison between ELSS and other tax-saving instruments: ELSSNSCPPFLock-in Period3 Years6 Years15 YearsMin.

Here are some details on the same:Salaried IndividualsFor salaried employees, contribution to Employees Provident Fund (EPF) becomes a part of yearly investment towards a fixed income product. For those looking to balance out the risk & returns in their portfolio, ELSS investment can be a good option.Apart from the possibility of higher returns, investments in ELSS also provide the benefit of tax deduction under section 80C. Although Unit Linked Insurance Plans (ULIPs) and the National Pension Scheme (NPS) also provide similar benefits, the setback is a higher lock-in period & lower scope of returns.ULIPs come with a lock-in period of five years, and NPS is considered an investment option for retirement since the invested amount is locked until the investor turns 60 years of age. Among all these, ELSS investment comes with the shortest lock-in period of three years.New InvestorsFor new investors who want to gain experience of equity investing through mutual funds along with tax benefits, ELSS can prove to be an ideal choice. Although equity investments come with substantial risk, it is generally in short term due to market fluctuations. If one remains invested for more than five years, the risk can be relatively lesser. New investors can begin ELSS exposure through monthly SIPs spread across the year. ELSS investment through SIP can help in accumulating more units when the market performance is in a downswing and may generate better returns as the market performance turns favourable. ELSS can come across as an excellent way of building wealth for a young investor as he/she can take some risks as the time is their side.How to invest in ELSS Funds?To invest in ELSS funds, investors can easily download and install the Fisdom  app and follow the below steps:Navigate to the ELSS mutual funds section on the app and go through the list of available optionsStudy the historical returns of the available options and select an option to investClick on Invest against the ELSS fund nameSelect SIP or lump-sum option and enter the amount to be investedContinue towards paymentEnter the bank and personal details to complete the investment process.How to redeem ELSS Units?In ELSS, every SIP instalment has to complete the mandatory 3-year lock-in period. Thus, if an investor invests in ELSS via SIP, after completion of 36 months he/she can only redeem the units allotted through the first SIP instalment. Subsequent units can be redeemed when they complete the three year lock-in period.Although investors can redeem their proportion units after completion of three-year lock-in period, it is not mandatory to do so. Once the lock-in period ends, the fund turns into a diversified, open-ended equity-oriented scheme. Therefore, investors can choose to redeem the units as per their requirement.It is important to note that the lock-in period is applicable on the date of purchase of the fund units or the SIP date. Let’s understand this with the help of an example:SIP DateUnitsLast Date of Lock-In Period 01 April 202110001 April 202401 May 20219501 May 202401 Jun 20219901 Jun 202401 Jul 202111001 Jul 2024As per the above example, SIP units purchased on 1st April 2021 can be redeemed after 1st April 2024. Similarly, units purchased on 1st July 2021 can only be redeemed after 1st July 2024.Factors to consider before investing in ELSS FundsHere are some factors to consider before investing in ELSS funds:Investment horizon: You need to have an investment horizon of longer than five years to consider investing in ELSS funds.Returns: You need to understand that ELSS funds do not provide guaranteed returns as they are dependent entirely on the performance of the underlying securities.Lock-in period: ELSS mutual funds come with a lock-in period of three years.Risk tolerance: ELSS funds are exposed to volatile market conditions because of their underlying securities.
