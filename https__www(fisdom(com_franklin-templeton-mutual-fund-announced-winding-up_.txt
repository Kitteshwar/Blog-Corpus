The liquidation process will be undertaken in line with regulatory guidance.This event does not change our stance on other funds managed by Franklin Templeton AMC.We continue to maintain our view of fixed-income investors shifting towards Sovereign-grade securities and consider AAA-rated securities per risk appetite. Even with AAA-rated securities, steering clear of stressed segments like NBFCs and HFCs till further revision in view should augur well for investors in the time to come.We have been continuously identifying and triggering a rebalancing campaign for investors exposed to credit risk beyond a threshold. Those accepting the rebalancing request would have effectively exited the affected schemes and continue to benefit from our active surveillance. For those who continued to invest in the affected schemes, there is no reason to panic as the fund house continues to focus on preserving maximum possible value for all unitholders and paying out the same.(Link to Notice by Franklin Templeton Mutual Fund: https://www.franklintempletonindia.com/downloadsServlet?docid=k8lf815l)Join our Fin Insight Community  Mutual Funds  Stocks Vs Equity Mutual Funds – Where Should you Invest? 30 May  5 minutes   Mutual Funds  Understanding CAGR: Compounded Annual Growth Rate Explained 26 May  6 minutes   Mutual Funds  How to Withdraw Money from Mutual Funds: A Guide to Redeeming and Selling Funds Online 26 May  6 minutes   Mutual Funds  Differences between Target Maturity Funds and Fixed Maturity Plans 25 May  6 minutes   Mutual Funds  SEBI Allows Investments in International Funds Again: All You Need to Know 25 May  8 minutes   Mutual Funds  Income Funds – Steady Income Generation with Low to Moderate Risks 14 May  7 minutes   Mutual Funds  Asset Allocation Funds – A Diversified Investment Strategy for Balanced Returns 14 May  6 minutes   Mutual Funds  Flexicap vs Multicap Funds – Understanding the Differences and Making the Right Choice 14 May  7 minutes   Mutual Funds  Credit Risk Funds – Understanding the Risks and Rewards of High-Yield Debt 13 May  8 minutes   Mutual Funds  Active vs. Passive vs. Balanced Funds: Which is Right for You? 13 May  9 minutes   Mutual Funds  Growth Funds – Investing in High-Potential Companies for Long-Term Capital Appreciation 13 May  8 minutes   Mutual Funds  PSU Debt Fund – A Safe Haven for Conservative Investors 13 May  10 minutes
